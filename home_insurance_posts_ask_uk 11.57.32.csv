Home insurance called our builder to haggle on claim - is this standard practice?,rm212,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1ecksu5/home_insurance_called_our_builder_to_haggle_on/,"Hi there, 

Just wanted to asked if people have ever heard of this happening. 

Our home insurance provider is currently settling a claim we had with them. They’re £275 off from what the cheapest builder of the three quotes we’ve submitted at asking for. It is a cash settlement, so they’re not engaging the builder directly. 

Today, they called the builder directly to try to haggle him down by the £275. We weren’t told that they were going to do this in advance, only after they had already done it. The builder has asked for the weekend to consider, just worried that they might get annoyed and pull out after being pressured by the insurance company directly. They were already over £1000 cheaper than the other two quotes. 

This direct contact to haggle with them seems very strange, I’ve never heard of it happening before. Has anyone else had an experience like this? 

Thanks in advance! "

What are my options for home insurance?,Anxious-G-231,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/17bdkq1/what_are_my_options_for_home_insurance/,"Hello! I moved to the UK 6 months ago. I’ve had issues getting a permanent place to rent but was able to get one two months after. My agent had suggested for me to get a home insurance (for my belongings as the landlord already has property insurance) but because of some other things I need to arrange to fully get settled in I haven’t gotten one yet. Four months into renting, I’ve been researching online but can only see 12 month plans, which is okay but me and my partner are planning to move to a bigger place after the contract here ends.

My question now is, are there options to obtain monthly insurance instead or less than 1 year coverage? Or if i get a one year insurance, will I be able to carryover the policy in case we successfully move after our current tenancy? 

Also, any suggestions? I was looking into Aviva and Admiral but would love to hear your thoughts?

I just discovered that my mum doesn't have ANY home insurance whatsoever. My mum owns her own house outright, mortgage paid off years ago, but she doesn't have home insurance. I told her she needs to have home insurance by law, and everything I have read online says I am right. Besides the utter foolishness of gambling with the weather that could destroy the house at any time and she'd lose everything without insurance to cover the cost, what if a brick blows off the roof and hits a pedestrian? She would be liable for millions in compensation. But she insists that it isn't a legal requirement and that nothing bad will come of not having it. How do I convince her that she is wrong and get her to buy insurance? I am seriously freaking out about this. I don't want to report her to the council but if she leaves me no alternative then I have to. I really just need to convince her to get insurance before they find out."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,MerlinOfRed,681,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/10o50ld/have_you_ever_gone_full_karen_and_asked_to_speak/,"I'm inspired by the replies on another thread about people turning into so-called 'Karens', but which I mean asking to speak to the manager. I used the ""can I speak with your manager"" line for the first time last week and it was mortifying. I was so ashamed of myself, but it worked and I got the result that I wanted.

I had been contacted by a debt collection agency informing me that I needed to pay them £75 due to unpaid cancellation fee on my home insurance. The problem was, I'd never cancelled my insurance and this was the first time I'd heard that my flat was uninsured. 

I renewed my insurance in November. I had received all the information documents on my online account. I checked them at the time and then got on with my life. Apparently it had been cancelled in December and I had no idea. I phoned the insurance, explained the situation, and I was back and forth with this lady for over an hour.

What had happened was that the payment hadn't gone through so they sent me a letter in the post informing me. They continued to send letters as they escalated the situation, cancelled my policy, slapped on a £40 fine, and then increased this to £75 when I still didn't pay. The issue was that although they had changed the flat that was insured, they hadn't actually updated my postal address. All these letters were going to my old flat. I was none the wiser.

The lady I was speaking to was insisting that I paid and saying that there was nothing she could do. After an hour of this, I asked if there was anyone else I could speak with. She first said ""I think my manager is busy, are you sure?"". I insisted. The manager solved the whole situation in under 3 minutes. The entire fee was waived, I was reinsured, and I even got two months insurance for free as a 'goodwill gesture'.

I feel guilty for asking to speak to the manager as it probably reflects badly on the likely overworked call centre employee, but I think she probably didn't have the permissions to do what needed to be done. By going to the manager I was able to save everyone valuable time - I only wish I'd done so sooner.

Does anyone else had a similar story? Or have you ever been on the other end and thought that the customer might have a point?"

I'll try to keep this short and to the point, but if more details are needed I am happy to provide. 

We claimed on our home insurance due to an escape of water and were told by the insurance company that they omit the VAT amount and we can reclaim it once the work has been done and we have provided invoices. 

The settlement figure was (round figures only) £24k with £4k removed for VAT and £500 reduced for the policy excess meaning we received £19.5k

I have sent them an invoice for £6k for the supply of a kitchen and have been told that I must reclaim all of the VAT in one go by providing invoices of at least the settlement figure (£19.5k).

He was the bank’s surveyor so valued the house at the correct/agreed price with no issues. According to the surveyor nothing to indicate any issues structurally (He is not a structural surveyor of course).

Our solicitors have raised this and asked for paperwork. The vendor has sent over some architectural drawings which talks about underpinning but when asked about building control sign off, the vendor responded by saying that they never got it. So our solicitors have gone back (without asking me), to push for a retrospective Building control inspection to sign off the works.

My question are:
1.	Is it common to have underpinning done when extending? It was a big extension, small bungalow to an almost 200sqm house. Our environmental survey did point the whole area as having soft soil so the whole town is at high risk of subsidence.
2.	Was there even a requirement to get things signed off by Building control back in 2006?

4.	Would home insurance be an issue? Some of them ask if there ever was underpinning and some specifically ask about subsidence.

What kind of insurance would help pay for personal items lost due to structural damage from rodents?,samzeman,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/qqqaiv/what_kind_of_insurance_would_help_pay_for/,"I rent a flat.

I know I'm making a few leaps here, and this answer wouldn't even help me if the rodents are already in the house and I don't have the insurance - but I'm paranoid. If they chew through something important and spray water all over the inside of the floor under my room, and the floor falls through or my room floods, is there a type of insurance that would protect my stuff (probably my computer most of all)? 

I know not renter's insurance from Google, and not home insurance. It's the landlord's duty to make sure rodents can't get in though, so as long as I've done all I can (not leaving food out, putting mesh on the holes I find)"
Are you paying more because you can’t pay upfront?,nottsgal,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/85wqa8/are_you_paying_more_because_you_cant_pay_upfront/,"The term 'poverty premium' is used to estimate how much more low-income households pay than higher income households for the same goods and services. 

It can mean that a typical low-income family can pay up to £1,700 per year more for the same essential goods and services as a similar higher income family. This is the equivalent of two months' rent outside of London.

The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Poverty is holding an inquiry to understand the extent of the 'poverty premium' so that it can make recommendations to Government and businesses on how to tackle it. To do this the APPG wants to hear your thoughts. 

There are many examples of the 'poverty premium' in practice, for example households on lower incomes are more likely to have to:

- prepay for their energy, even though this is more expensive than paying for it monthly
- use expensive credit like payday loans to make ends meet 
- pay for household goods like TVs or washing machines in instalments, despite this sometimes costing three times as much as paying upfront
- pay for car or home insurance monthly, despite this costing more than paying annually

Do you get your boiler serviced annually?

It’s that time of year again and by god is it hard to find someone willing to do such a “small” job. More than one local engineer has asked why on Earth I’d bother with a service…

…well it’s a requirement of our home insurance for cover (presumably for boiler related things) to be valid. Must be <15 years old and serviced annually.

What's the fairest way to split household bills?,Far_Camel_5098,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/xqa61v/whats_the_fairest_way_to_split_household_bills/,"I am a divorced single parent.  My kids are 20 and 17.  Eldest at Uni but living at home.  Youngest doing A levels at college.

My new partner moved in during lockdown and we've decided to live together forever now.   I'll be adding her to the mortgage and we will become ""tenants in common"" so that I can protect the equity I built up before we met, but she can have a stake in the property and benefit from the home improvements she's done with me since moving in.

If we stay together forever I'll probably sign over half of the house to her eventually, or split it 3 ways between her and my kids.

My question is about the other household bills I.e. NOT the mortgage.

It wouldn't be fair for me to ask her to pay 1/2 of energy, council tax, water and home insurance etc.  After all - my kids are not her kids and she's not responsible for them.

But the kids aren't earning yet apart from a bit of cash from part time jobs so I don't think her paying 1/4 of the bills is fair on me either.

So do I just split the difference between 1/4 and 1/2 and ask her to pay 1/3?"

I've noticed in my downstairs toilet the flooring feels a bit sponge-y near the wall, which has a radiator on it, and on the corner where the toilet is... i.e. a lot of water-type stuff. Therefore, I am wondering if I've got a leak somewhere. 

I've isolated the radiator, which hasn't improved the situation (perhaps made it worse as its not drying out anymore?), and I can't see anything obviously wrong around the toilet pan. Do I need a generic plumber to help find the suspected leak or would it be a handyman or specialist like a drain engineer? I've got emergency coverage on my home insurance however that can only be used once the leak has been identified (""trace and access"" is not included, apparently)

My Home emergency claim is on hold because the locksmith's company has an invalid VAT number. What do I do?,BlackKojak,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/pejkya/my_home_emergency_claim_is_on_hold_because_the/,"Last Wednesday, I accidentally locked myself out of my flat at night.

I panicked and looked up a [locksmith company](https://nearest-locksmith24.co.uk/) through Google. They assigned me a locksmith that arrived in 20 mins.

While waiting, I was curious to find out if my home insurance offers and covers it. They offered a £500 emergency repair cover and affiliated companies. I told them I called one on the way but would've gone through them if I knew ahead of time. They assured me that they'd reimburse me as long as I provide the itemised receipt and cause of the issue.

The locksmith arrived, I explained the situation (key on the inside, lock jammed) then gave me a quote for the job. He did a great job and replaced the old lock with a new secure lock. He gave me a receipt, I paid then went his way.

While scanning the receipts, I wondered why the locksmith didn't ask to confirm if I'm the homeowner. I thought that would've been part of the procedure.

**Recent development**

My home insurer calls back to let me know **my claim is on hold** because the locksmith's VAT number is invalid. They've asked me to provide a valid VAT number but don't know how to get in touch with the locksmith's company.

I've tried:

1. Contacting the locksmith agency (they told me to contact the locksmith)
2. Contacting the tradesman (not responding to calls or recent texts)
3. Sending an email to the locksmith company (Name, address, email, business and VAT number are on the receipt)
4. Contacting Citizens Advice Bureau (aren't available since it's a bank holiday)
5. Looking up the company via [Companies Register](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11897036). They are active but have no contact info.

If I can't get hold of the locksmiths, what options do I have? I was really looking forward to getting my £390 back."

"House insurance, what should I do?",Richie2516,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/szse7g/house_insurance_what_should_i_do/,"Evening all,

Obligatory typed on mobile warning.

Sorry for the long boring post but not sure where else to address to.

In November last year, my neighbour had a small electrical fire in his loft (not a grow...) luckily he spotted it straight away and had fire brigade there in minutes.  I'd only moved in 6 days prior to this and due to the shifts I was on I hadn't got round to emptying the storage facility that all the non essential stuff for the house move was kept which included the entire contents of my loft.

The only affect on my property was smoke damage, it did blacken all the boards and insulation in the loft so this has been replaced under (currently) my home insurance with a £250 excess.

It did mean however that I had to leave the contents of my loft in storage so I brought home what I could and reduced the storage size as much as I was able to and started a new contract which ran for 3 months, ending 4 days after my loft was boarded out.  When I last spoke to the insurance company they stated because the loft was empty during the fire they will not reimburse the cost of storage for the 3 months.

This week scaffolding has been put up next door to address the issues with the neighbours roof, the company did contact me to ask permission to overhang on my property slightly to provide more cover to which I agreed as I didn't think it would cause an issue but they have removed the top bracket on my TV aerial and rested it on the side of the chimney to fit this cover over, this has left me without live TV for the next 6 weeks.

So my questions are;

Do I get my excess back through neighbours insurance?
Should I be entitled to the cost of storage being refunded?
What can I do about not having TV due to scaffolding next door?

Thanks."

I own a leasehold flat with my husband. The windy rains make our ceilings against the exterior of the flat leak.

I'm an expat, so I don't really know how these things work.

We live on the ground floor of a 4 unit house. 3 units are leasehold, and the one above ours is an elderly council resident. The building belongs to the council.

Last January and February we noticed whenever there was a particularly bad combo of rain and wind, our window sill in the bedroom would be covered in water. We have narrowed the water entrance down to a crack along where the wall meets drop ceiling over the window. 

We believe the bricks of the building are letting water in when the wind blows it at the right angle and it's running in to our flat. I called the council last winter to query, but nothing was done and I never heard back. 

I want to call insurance, but my husband insists home insurance won't cover it when the bricks belong to the council. The council didn't return my calls last year. I've just come into my bedroom today to see the same.

We've just repainted and are trying to make a home for ourselves. I really don't want it to mould and fall apart to damp around our feet.

Can someone please, please advise me what the right course of action is?

"Who is responsible for a roof repair, me or the factors?",WellFiredRoll,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/sxadir/who_is_responsible_for_a_roof_repair_me_or_the/,"I've lived in my top-floor flat for about a decade now and up until this past week I've not had any major issues.  We all know what happened this week and whilst my building was well out of the way of Eunice and her temper tantrum (I'm in Glasgow), I've noticed that my roof has started to leak.  I had someone go into the roof-space for me a few days ago and he came back down and said, yup, there's water getting into the roof-space round about a roof anchor (it's a metal loop fixed into the roof that allows for maintenance workers to hook themselves safely to the building).  Thing is:  the water damage itself must have been going on for the past couple of years and I know that my building hasn't had the normal annual inspection of the roof anchors because of You Know What.  

So, now I've got a roofing contractor coming up to assess the damage and see if they can implement a quick-fix on Tuesday (and if they can't, they'll try and at least mitigate the ingress).  That's fine.  I'm not really that fussed about getting the roof fixed - I have good insurance, never made a claim, all that jazz.  But I've started worrying (at the speed of dark, such as the way my mind works) - but I am worried about getting the water-staining on my ceiling fixed.  Should I get the factor to repair that (even though I own my flat, someone pointed out to me that the ingress itself isn't my fault and my factor should have made arrangements for an inspection as soon as the various lockdowns came to an end) or should I claim it on my home insurance?  I don't want to arse it up - I'm planning on selling up and moving to a smaller place this year and I'm worrying about my insurance company demanding to know why I never reported the ingress to *them* in the first place.  As you can tell, yeah, I'm pretty shit at this sort of thing.  I mean, is the roof repair solely my responsibility (because it's affecting only my flat) or is it the responsibility of the factor (because they maintain the entire fabric of the building)?"

Bad experience with an insurance company and don't know where I stand?,tolpedicat,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/6vzjxi/bad_experience_with_an_insurance_company_and_dont/,"sorry if this doesn't belong here - just let me know and I will remove :)
This is long. I am going to bullet point most of it so it's easier to digest. A little background though - me and my partner bought a house a few months ago, and 3 insurance policies (as far as i can gather) were set up by our financial adviser with no input from us. The UK company is a very well known one, which I thought were well thought of (a google search shows them having a 3.1 on TrustPilot though). The insurance I think we have is critical illness cover for the two of us, and home insurance. Here are the issues we've had.

1) We have had no confirmation from the company that we have any policies with them. so i'm only assuming what we have - I have nothing solid on paper or digitally. yes, they're charging us monthly for these.

2) Because we have no confirmation, we have no policy number or any terms/conditions. This is the only reason why we haven't stopped paying in case they charge us some extortionate fee that we cannot afford, because we don't know the terms of cancellation.

3) The very few letters they've sent has gone to our old addresses, even though they have our new one. They sent out a form for us to complete in June, (which we only got from the people living there in August) and on the letter it states that if it's not sent back to them within 14 days they cannot start the policy (this is how I know we have Critical Illness Cover - they were health forms for it). They haven't received a response, but they're still charging for it. Have they contacted us asking why we haven't responded? nope.

4) We have no terms and conditions. For anything. For example I'm pretty sure we have home insurance with them, but if something was to happen we have no idea who to call, what to quote and what the hell is covered and what's not.

5) I've emailed. with all of the above. they told us to 'login to our account online' to see what we have. um, we can't? you've never sent us any login details or anything? so we set that up - but now we're locked out because their friggin password didn't work. To sort it we have to call a number that charges. Great. Thanks guys

6) When I emailed them, they didn't respond to me, but emailed my partner. Pretty rude but whatever. Shows they have his contact details though. OH - and the email had terrible grammar, the wrong dates and seemed to be written by a 9 year old ... to the point where we thought it was a scam at first.

Please help. Any advice about anything will help. I'm just sick of being in the dark and I feel like i'm stuck paying these guys. :("

Getting an idea about quality of life and cost of living in Cheshire (potential job opportunity near Warrington)?,fertthrowaway,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/r7n840/getting_an_idea_about_quality_of_life_and_cost_of/,"Hi, I'm American and my husband is Hungarian and we have a 3 year old daughter. We're currently living in the Bay Area of CA. We moved here in early 2018 after spending several years in the Copenhagen metro area, since I got a job offer with relocation and I wanted to try out the crazy biotech scene here. I have a PhD and work in biotech (very specific niche role for which there are more jobs in the Bay Area than anywhere else) and my husband also has a PhD and is currently a senior engineer at a global company with a UK office in Gloucestershire. He might be able to arrange remote work with them and a lot of their UK staff are remote (he is currently over 95% work from home now).

While there are things we like here, it's crazy expensive and competitive and I felt like I missed Denmark since the moment we got here. I've mostly readjusted to the US but things that used to be normal to me drive me nuts now. Salaries are really high but it still feels like the cost of living eats it up. Quality of life is particularly poor where we're located in this region due to high crime and homelessness, and housing is too expensive to do anything but indefinitely rent and we're in our 40s and tired of this.

So I was recently contacted on LinkedIn by a UK headhunter for a highly appropriate role (right level and exactly what I do) and found out in a call today that the job is between Liverpool and Manchester (looked up exact location and it seems to be in a research park south of Warrington, technically in Daresbury) and he thinks I'd be in the £55-60k salary range. If my husband could arrange something with his company, he would most likely also be in that range. Of course still a lot to get through with interviewing, and maybe they'll just prefer a UK candidate in the end etc, but I'm trying to figure out what things look like cost of living wise there with £110-120k combined salaries? What would after tax monthly income look like, after pension and tax and all that? How much does childcare typically cost in this region and is it hard to find spots in daycares? How are public schools? 

We would want to buy a house if we went there, maybe after initially renting to get our bearings. I'm seeing 3 br free-standing homes listed for minimum £250-400k in the area (what does it mean when a listing says e.g. ""offers in excess of £235k"" - and do homes go well over list price usually or close to it? Bay Area is absurd and stuff goes for $300+k over list in bidding wars so I have no idea anymore). I could put a large deposit of maybe up to £120k and real estate website says on that for a £300k price it'd only be £634/mo on a 35 year mortgage (friend there told us if you get a 35 year loan you can pay it back early, which we would definitely do at that price) which seems really low. What other costs are there, are there property taxes, home insurance etc and what would those add? 

Thanks for any ballpark ideas and numbers, or any other comments about this region...would save me a lot of time vs extensive research when I don't even have an employment offer yet. I was happy the position was not in the southeast although I know the northwest is more rough but ""up and coming"", or at least that's been my impression."
Garage door has broken just before house move.,MaltDizney,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/9obaie/garage_door_has_broken_just_before_house_move/,"Me and the Mrs are moving out of her owned flat in a couple days, and due to Murphy's law the garage door has decided to break (I believe a cable has snapped or something) preventing it from closing.


We have NO time to deal with this before the move takes place, how do we go about sorting this out? Is it something that we're obligated to do?


Some additional notes, the home insurance has ended and the new owners policy has commenced as of the contract exchange date last week. But I didn't want to assume that they should just make a claim under their policy. If its a case of they move in, and we're liable to pay then so be it, and less stress as we'd have moved by then.


Edit: Thanks for all the responses. We ended up telling our solicitor, and she arranged for a modest retention fee to be left to the buyer for cost of fixing. Made life much easier not having to deal with it directly."
A landlord is avoiding paying council tax - am I liable for tax evasion?,tax_pedant,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2a9e88/a_landlord_is_avoiding_paying_council_tax_am_i/,"So I'm currently looking around for a place to rent. Found the perfect house that ticks all the boxes - on viewing the property and meeting the landlord, they tell me that I won't have to pay council tax or for Sky TV.

How the landlord explained the situation: the house was previously a holiday home (as are four other homes on the landlord's site). The landlord deliberately hasn't  registered the house with the council as a permanent residence since it stopping being a holiday home, so there is no council tax. 

Now obviously, this is dodgy and absolutely evading paying council tax and makes me very uncomfortable. I'm pretty sure that all the other properties on the site are in the same position. My question is - how much of this is my problem? I know it is the tenant's responsibility to pay council tax, but is it the tenant's responsibility to get the property correctly assessed by the council? Would I be liable through knowing about it and not reporting it?

It rang a lot of alarm bells: would having the home not properly assessed void my home insurance in the case of an accident? Could I not join the electoral register in the area as the council would then know I'm living in a non-listed house? 

Many thanks for any help you knowledgeable people can give!
