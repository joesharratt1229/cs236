Leasehold Buildings and Contents Insurance,worldlive,2,"As a leaseholder for many years, I've had a few issues, and my advice isn't to bother with supplemental buildings insurance as you'll be paying for something that's largely already in place for a risk you can easily mitigate by being careful not to drill into pipes etc.

There's also things you can't insure away - you'll most likely find in your lease that any services that solely supply your flat will be your responsibility, even if it's not in the flat. E.g. if a pipe in a corridor that only supplies your flat bursts, that's on you to pay for. So rather than try and insure every edge case, I'd just have a little safety cushion and roll with it.

Just save a bit each month into a pot for when things do go wrong. Do get contents insurance though!"
Leasehold Buildings and Contents Insurance,SandyArbuthnot,1,"Nice one, thanks for the detailed reply!

>if a pipe in a corridor that only supplies your flat bursts, that's on you to pay for

Interesting, I'll bear that in mind.

>Just save a bit each month into a pot for when things do go wrong

Yep, good shout. The excess on these policies is a few hundred anyway."

House insurance - how do they know your contents,1987RAF,7,"This is scary. Your solicitor should have informed you, you needed at least building insurance from the point of exchange if mortgaged as it will be part of your mortgage requirements.

Anyway, thats by the by now. Most people have the same things, sofas, tv’s etc so they are easy to account for. They will generally ask if there is anything unique or over a certain price you want insured individually. If theres anything you want to insure individually make sure you photograph it, get it valued for insurance purposes and get the certificate.

You usually insure for a value of all contents (say £15,000) in case the whole house goes up in flames and then they go from there.

Read up on over insuring and under insuring or call  an insurer and tell them you are new and want to discuss how it works. Some are surprisingly helpful"
House insurance - how do they know your contents,Unlikely_Concept5107,3,"It’s been a fair few years since I worked in Personal Lines insurance but I don’t imagine it works too much differently now.

Essentially, most companies now offer blanket cover (i.e. they cover everyone up to the same limit of say £50k) but will make an estimate for your particular contents based on some of the info you provide when obtaining a quote:

- Num of bedrooms
- Type of property(flat, detached, etc.)
- Num of occupants
- Postcode
- Others that I don’t remember now

This estimate is used to help calculate your premium.

In the event of a total loss they’ll then ask you to go room by room, naming what was in there and putting a value on everything.  You’ll then come to an agreement on how much they will pay you.

If you include something that doesn’t seem to fit with your profile (say a £20k sofa in a one bed flat in a rough part of town), you’ll probably (definitely!) be asked to provide proof.

As the other poster said, there will be additional limits for certain types of items like jewellery/artwork/cash that they won’t pay beyond, unless these were disclosed and agreed at the outset."

Contents insurance - how does it work?,itallstartedwithapub,8,"The terms of the policy will state whether you get new-for-old (a 10 year old sofa will be replaced with a brand new one) or like-for-like (for a 10 year old sofa you'll be reimbursed the residual value i.e. almost nothing). 

Insurance is designed to put you back in the situation you would have been in should the insured event not have happened. You won't get £100k if your contents were worth £10k, so there's little point in excessively over insuring."
Contents insurance - how does it work?,geekypenguin91,3,"No, you're covered up to the value of £100k.

In the event of a claim, they will send an assessor round to determine the value of the goods that need replacing.

If they assess your contents as worth £10k then that's what you'll get.
Anything high value should be specified items on your policy, but they still may ask for proof, such as a purchase receipt or even a photo proving ownership.


But tldr, no, you can't just claim £100k"

Contents insurance - how does it work?,[deleted],3,"Because they're not stupid.

They know that a 1 bed flat in Skegness isn't likely to have 100k worth of furniture, 12 rolexes, etc.

They know most people have an average amount of furniture and possessions, the quality and cost of which is probably proportional to the area, most people have some nice clothes and some average clothes, most people may have 1 or 2 nice/expensive bits of jewelery/watches, etc etc etc.

Although it's important to add everything up, it's very easy to underinsure. For example, the stack of board games we have would cost around £500 to replace, etc - the numbers very quickly add up if you take every little detail into account.

If you way overvalued a claim, they'd ask you to prove it. Then you'd potentially be on the hook for insurance fraud."
Contents insurance - how does it work?,erm_what_,0,"It's up to you to justify the amount, bit up to them to bring the claim amount down. They'd be happy to give you next to nothing if you have no evidence to backup your claim. Photos are ok, but receipts are better."
Contents insurance - how does it work?,geekypenguin91,1,"The advantage of insuring a little over is for when/if you buy anything else during the policy year or if things cost more to replace than you think.

Some insurers get quite funny if the assessor comes up with a value greater than your policy value and some have even refused to pay out.



It is very rare that everything is completely destroyed in a fire, there's usually enough left to identify the main things. Some stuff will be assigned standard values if you can't prove yours was particularly expensive"

Does my contents insurance cover damage to the flat below if my washing machine floods?,xxnicknackxx,3,"Your insurance ought to include at least two elements. 

One is insuring the property you own (eg your contents) on a first party basis against specified perils. If your stuff is damaged by said perils, and the cause is not otherwise excluded, you can claim compensation from your insurer up to the sums insured. 

The other element is insuring you for your liability to third parties in relation to your status as leasholder/tenant. This covers you for the compensation a court would find you liable to pay to a third party for damage or injury occurring as a result of your negligence (in relation to your status as leasholder/tenant). 

If your neighbour suffers damage from a leak in their ceiling, which appears to be caused by your washing machine, the best thing for them to do is claim on their own insurance. Escape of water from tank or apparatus is typically an insured peril under the first party covers. It then becomes their insurers' problem to try to recover that cost from you *if they can demonstrate negligence*. If such a negligence claim against you arose, you would notify your insurer and any compensation due would be covered by the liability to third parties part of your policy. 

Negligence is the established route to obtain compensation from 3rd parties via the courts. However just because a loss has been suffered doesn't mean that it automatically follows that negligence can be shown. 

If such a claim against you arose, your insurer would probably deny liability to the third party. They aren't in the business of giving money away that they are not forced to give away. At this point the 3rd party or their insurers would decide whether to give up on pursuing you, or take you to court. If they go through with taking you to court, your insurer would be contractually obligated to you to cover the costs. In reality if they assess that the claimant will win, they will just pay. 

That is to say that it is quite common that people suffering leaks from upstairs have no recourse against the people living upstairs as it is usually quite difficult to establish negligence in these situations. If they buy insurance then they don't really need to worry about recovery as the first party insurance will make them whole (albeit with a potential premium increase at renewal). The people who don't buy insurance are in a more challenging position as they would need to be prepared to take the people upstairs to court to try to win any compensation.

ETA insurance packages branded as leasholder insurance or renters insurance or similar will typically include at least these two elements of cover. The policies themselves will clarify. They may also include options for insuring property away from the specified address, such as laptops and bikes. They may also include legal expenses insurance which gives limited cover for a mixed bag of other legal issues (eg pursuit of personal injury). Other types of insurance may be less comprehensive. Gadget insurance or cover for contents only may not include the liability to third parties element."
Does my contents insurance cover damage to the flat below if my washing machine floods?,Anaksanamune,0,Normally the flat below would claim on their their insurance who would go after yours for the payment.
Does my contents insurance cover damage to the flat below if my washing machine floods?,devtastic,2,"Thanks. I appreciate the detailed answer but I don't really understand. I was hoping for a yes, no, it depends answer.

>Your insurance ought to include at least two elements.

What do you mean by ""ought"" in this context? Do you mean a contents insurance policy will probably contain those 2 elements? Or that a contents policy will typically not contain 3rd party cover so you should buy that as well?

Are you essentially saying,

* No, my contents insurance would not cover the damage to the flat below because these typically only cover 1st party, i.e. damage to my flat.
* If I want something that definitely covers 3rd party then I would have to take out an ""ETA insurance package"" instead/as well as a contents policy. However I have no idea what an ""ETA insurance package"" is and google tells me it's an American insurer but I'm guessing that is not what you meant. \[1\]
* However that is not really necessary in practice because if the flat below me, or their insurance tried to sue me, the legal cover part of my contents policy would kick in and essentially cover me for various reasons, e.g., they might decide it is cheaper to pay the costs of replacing the third party's ceiling than going to court.

To clarify, when I go to Compare the market and such like, they give me an option of ""Contents"", ""Buildings"" or ""Contents and Buildings"". This is what I as a layman mean by ""Contents insurance Cover"", I'm guessing you may be using a more accurate/specific definition. 

I'm really just asking if I buy a contents policy from Axa will it cover me if I flood downstairs? Or would it only cover me if I also bought the legal cover?

Thanks again."
Does my contents insurance cover damage to the flat below if my washing machine floods?,xxnicknackxx,2,"""Ought"" as in you should seek cover that includes at least both of these elements. You're unlikely to go wrong with packages marketed for leaseholders/tenants as they will usually include both, but sometimes the covers may be optional (3rd party liability cover is sometimes an optional section in these packages). It's best to get these covers as part of the same package from the same insurer. Just search for quotes for leasholder or tenant insurance and check the separate sections of cover included. 

>* No, my contents insurance would not cover the damage to the flat below because these typically only cover 1st party, i.e. damage to my flat.

Correct, but the 3rd party cover you should get alongside the first party cover will protect you from potential liability to 3rd parties. You can't really insure stuff you don't own, apart from in some specific circumstances, so the 3rd party liability cover is as close as you can get to insuring your neighbour's property in the event that you damage it. 

Car insurance works more or less the same. In that context you are obligated to insure your liability to 3rd parties, because you are partaking in an inherently dangerous activity, whereas the first party cover for damage to your own vehicle is optional. 

>ETA insurance package

ETA = edit to add. Sorry, my mistake, I should have written as ""ETA: Insurance packages...""

>* However that is not really necessary in practice because if the flat below me, or their insurance tried to sue me, the legal cover part of my contents policy would kick in and essentially cover me for various reasons, e.g., they might decide it is cheaper to pay the costs of replacing the third party's ceiling than going to court.

Yes. Although be careful about the language as whilst the 3rd party liability cover will pay legal expenses and compensation due following a negligence claim, this is not the same as ""Legal Expenses Insurance"" which also comes with some of these packages, either built in or optional. 

Legal Expenses cover gives some limited cover and access to a legal helpline for other issues not related to your liability for negligent damage or injury. 3rd party liability cover is pretty essential (although not a legal requirement), legal expenses cover is nice to have but wouldn't help at all in the event of a negligent damage claim. It may help with some other problems that arise though.

>To clarify, when I go to Compare the market and such like, they give me an option of ""Contents"", ""Buildings"" or ""Contents and Buildings"". This is what I as a layman mean by ""Contents insurance Cover"", I'm guessing you may be using a more accurate/specific definition.

If the property is leased, you likely have no legal interest in insuring the building because it isn't your building. Your risk is in the loss of your contents and also in what others might sue you for seeking compensation for negligence. Go down the contents route, but be aware that you also want that cover for 3rd party liability, which may be automatically included with the contents, optional, or not included at all, so check what risks the actual policy addresses. 

>I'm really just asking if I buy a contents policy from Axa will it cover me if I flood downstairs? Or would it only cover me if I also bought the legal cover?

It will only cover you for liability to compensate downstairs if a section of the policy you buy covers liability for negligence.  Buying a ""contents"" policy may do that, because that's what people insuring contents also usually want in addition and the insurers who create these packages are aware of that need. However the concept of ""covering contents"" suggests first party loss only and doesn't inherently suggest that third party liability cover is also included, so you should check the details of the cover you are looking to purchase."
Does my contents insurance cover damage to the flat below if my washing machine floods?,devtastic,2,"Thanks again, for the detailed answer, but to be honest I am still none the wiser. 

If I search for leaseholder policies I just get stuff about buildings insurance.

If I search for tenant insurance I get stuff for renters, not leaseholders.

>Your risk is in the loss of your contents and also in what others might sue you for seeking compensation for negligence. Go down the contents route, but be aware that you also want that cover for 3rd party liability, which may be automatically included with the contents, optional, or not included at all, so check what risks the actual policy addresses.  
It will only cover you for liability to compensate downstairs if a section of the policy you buy covers liability for negligence.

Have you ever seen a policy that does cover for 3rd party liability or liability for negligence? What specifically should I look for?

The frustration I have, and the reason why I made this post, is that I just can't tell because none of the policy documents I've seen mention other parties. They just say ""your contents"" and the like. They don't list third parties in inclusions or exclusions. 

For example, [https://www.axa.co.uk/home-insurance/contents-insurance/](https://www.axa.co.uk/home-insurance/contents-insurance/) is a detailed page, but it says nothing about third parties. 

[https://www.axa.co.uk/globalassets/pdfs/home/policy-docs/april-2023/axa-direct-home-premier-policy-wording-acpd0402p-b.pdf](https://www.axa.co.uk/globalassets/pdfs/home/policy-docs/april-2023/axa-direct-home-premier-policy-wording-acpd0402p-b.pdf) is the more detailed version,  and says 

* ""Loss or damage resulting from escape of water. Sudden and unexpected water leaking from or freezing in any washing machine, dishwasher, fridge, freezer or fixed domestic water, drainage or heating installation. "" 
* ""Your cover for escape of water is designed to cover damage to your property caused by water leaks.""

But it does not list third parties under exclusions. I just assumed it would say somewhere ""we do not cover damage to adjacent properties"" or similar.

Or am I mistaken regarding the freeholder's building insurance not kicking in here? Am I wrong in assuming that the building insurance would not pay for their new ceiling if my washing machine destroyed it? It might be that I have to pay the excess or something, but perhaps they wold cover the rest?

I was hoping this would be simpler but I think I going to have to phone Axa and other and ask them what happens if my washing machine destroys the flat downstairs's ceiling.

Thanks again."

I really dislike policy summaries, such as the ones you link as  I feel they are easy to interpret incorrectly, but being shorter documents policyholders read those rather than the longer and more detailed policy wordings. The wording forms the main part of your contract with the insurer. Summaries are just a snapshot of the wording. 

[This is the link ](https://www.axa.co.uk/home-insurance/policy-details/#axa-home) to AXA's actual wordings for these products. 

If you pick the top Home Insurance one and go to the Contents section, near the end you will find a subsection under ""Tenant's Liability"" which details the cover for your liability to third parties arising in respect of you being a tenant (the leaky washing machine scenario). Remember that a leashold is a form of tenancy, rather than ownership. 

AXA choose to write this as a subsection of the contents cover, some other insurers might give it its own section separate to contents. In this product, they have designed it to be suitable for tenants and homeowners alike as they have included an optional section for buildings insurance. Similarly, at the end of that section there is property owners liability which might address things like negligence resulting in a falling roof tile causing an injury or a tree on the property grounds falling and causing damage to 3rd party property. As a tenant you don't need that, so it is ring-fenced in the buildings section only to be included by people who need to insure a building. 

Other products might be tenant specific and not include a buildings section. Rather than Home Insurance, they might be called something like Tenants insurance, or a variety of other stuff. There isn't really any standardisation in what these products are called. Home Insurance is probably the best thing to search, but be a bit careful that you aren't buying a product more specifically designed for property owners. It should become clear what the product is designed for or can accommodate in the questions asked. If it's asking a bunch of irrelevant questions, then it probably isn't designed for your use. 

>Or am I mistaken regarding the freeholder's building insurance not kicking in here? Am I wrong in assuming that the building insurance would not pay for their new ceiling if my washing machine destroyed it? It might be that I have to pay the excess or something, but perhaps they wold cover the rest?

The freeholders' buildings insurance protects them. You have no contractual relationship with their insurer and so cannot force the insurer to pay to compensate you for your loss (unless resulting from the freeholder's negligence, in which case their duty is still to compensate the freeholder, but for what the freeholder is legally liable to pay you).

The negligent party is responsible and in negligence claims establishing the cause is important. If the leak happened because the freeholder failed to maintain the pipes correctly, they are likely responsible. If you failed to maintain your washing machine correctly, you're probably liable, if the neighbours can show this. In reality establishing cause for leaks and pinning it on negligence can be challenging and insurers often cut their losses unless it is a straightforward case to make, which means that everyone is well advised to have their own insurances in their own names for the insurable risks that they each face."

Building and contents insurance,DigitalStefan,1,"Massively depends on the level of cover you're looking for. Our mortgage broker was keen to upsell us insurance and we let her (she was excellent). We had a long list of possible options ranging from about where you're looking up past £500/year.

We opted for something around £400/year because it covered a bunch of stuff that would absolutely *suck* in our first year if we had a loss on those things and they weren't covered.

Paid it outright and we're putting £40/month into an account to pay for whatever we decide to go for on renewal."

Insurance claim processes can be difficult to understand if you're not in the industry so when they don't pay out you make out its the companies fault and badly review them. 3. Everyone expects it to be fixed with a click of your fingers, things take time and processes have to be followed, plus you're not the companies only claim. 4. Most people only leave reviews to complain. Source: work in the insurance industry. If you get quotes from various companies, pick a budget and then look into the the quotes surrounding your budget.

Any tips for building insurance and contents insurance?,Heirsandgraces,3,"I've just swapped my FIL's and saved around £130 on renewal - went through Quidco (cashback site) and got £30 back for using go-compare

Then the cheapest deal for me was Halifax - which offered £50 cashback after 60 days. The renewal quote was £220 and I paid £147 but with the £80 cashback it will have cost just £67 for the year. Thats with 50,000 contents cover and accidental damage for both. 

You can customise your cover as you're doing the quote - look out for the option to insure personal items when you're filling out the form :) "

Contents insurance for lodgers in one furnished ensuite room in shared house,J-Fox-Writing,2,"Ooo thanks for letting me know! I don't know much about this stuff - been trying to figure it all out but not had much time before having to relocate. The landlady seems good for everything - it used to be a B&B that she ran but has recently turned it into a house share. She has all safety certificates (fire alarms, carbon monoxide etc.). Is there anything else we should look out for? Will this change what we look for with contents insurance?

[edit] also I'm not 100% sure she's considered live-in, since she said she travels a lot and is rarely there (think she might have more properties). I can always ask her though"
Contents insurance for lodgers in one furnished ensuite room in shared house,Spify23,2,"5 or more people or 3 or more households needs to be licensed as an HMO (London has harsher rules)

You can ask your landlord if she has an HMO license and you can contact your local council housing office.

If she is renting out more than 3 rooms and using the property as her main home then she needs an HMO license or a Temporary Exemption Notice (TEN).

Being a licensed HMO is more than having fire alarms and carbon monoxide testers. The rooms need to a certain size, bigger for 2 people, fire doors, sufficient fire escapes etc"
"Contents insurance due to expire, but don’t have an exchange/ completion date on new house",gskaeo,2,"I don’t think you can get one month’s worth of insurance. 

You’re best off getting contents insurance now and then cancelling it when you move; you’ll get a pro rata refund minus a cancellation fee so definitely worth asking how much this is before purchasing. The cheapest might not be the best for you if the cancellation fee is higher than others.

If my understanding is correct, the insurer won’t allow you to change address and just “add” buildings cover - it would be a new quote.

Hope that helps."

Advice on things to do after buying first property?,Loud_Low_9846,1,I would query why you need life insurance if you have no dependants. Instead think about taking out a mortgage protection policy to cover your payments if you lose your job or become too ill to work.
Advice on things to do after buying first property?,Sicsempertyranismor,7,People are mongs
Advice on things to do after buying first property?,TheZZ9,1,Very quick and easy to do. Lots of videos on YouTube showing how. You only need to change the barrel not the whole lock. A typical Yale front door lock should take well under ten minutes and need a screwdriver. A modern Eurolock can be done in under one minute.

Responsibility for internal front door,TheFirstMinister,2,It's been a long time since I worked in buildings insurance claims but IIRC a front door of the type you described would not fall under contents.  I suspect I'm right but my memory is hazy and definitions may well have changed.  Someone else on here will know the answer.
Responsibility for internal front door,Mysterious-Peach-595,1,"From speaking to our contents insurer we're pretty sure this is the case.

It's still unclear whether this is normally covered under buildings insurance though - if it isn't surely there's a big gap in our insurance policy/policies."
Responsibility for internal front door,TheFirstMinister,1,"For the life of me I cannot remember.  I settled/repudiated hundreds - maybe thousands of buildings claims - and I cannot recall doing so for a door.  Again, however, it was a looooong time ago now.

I do remember, however, a claim form \[we had paper back then\] come in where the insured was claiming for a pair of spectacles.  In the ""Describe The Event"" section the old fella' wrote - and I remember it almost by heart:

""*My pet magpie stole my spectacles and flew them up into a tree. I cannot reach them.  He has also stolen spoons and forks in the past*"".

Claim rejected."

FTB - Home Insurance,jacekowski,1,"Why not just have both start at the same time, savings are going to be pretty minimal if any.

£118/year for both with aviva."
FTB - Home Insurance,nano-moose,1,"That's a good shout tbf - I had just assumed I needed to do each separately. Not seeing anything as cheap as £118/year anywhere, maybe just particulars in my situation."
FTB - Home Insurance,jacekowski,1,"Are you selecting any stupid options like legal cover, insurance away from home, accidental damage or 0 excess?

I've just ran through through a quote at moneysupermarket and it came out to £84 for cheapest option, but i can easily make it £400 for cheapest quote by adding few extras."
FTB - Home Insurance,nano-moose,1,"Yes except the 0 excess lol. Was told by a colleague to add legal cover. Got my bike, laptop and camera insured away from home. Thought accidental damage would be good if I'm redoing bits of the house. Why don't you think they're necessary?"
FTB - Home Insurance,jacekowski,2,"Because you are paying £300/year extra for that cover, with minimum excess of around £200 (maybe more if you add voluntary excess) and if you use the policy you will be slapped with increase in your insurance costs so high that you will regret ever claiming on it. So it is better to save that money and spend it on replacing/fixing it yourself.

Insurances companies never lose money (in the long term, they will lose money in short term) which should tell you something, It is always cheaper to self insure in long term, it is worth it to insure against rare catastrophic events because it would take very long time to recover from something like that (for example with £100 building insurance for house with 250k rebuild cost would take 208 years to recoup the cost if house burned down, but houses burn down a lot less frequently on average so insurance company still wins here), but paying £300/year + £200 per event to insure laptop worth £500 (have a look how much your laptop or camera is worth on ebay - insurance company will not be replacing yours with a new one, but giving you money for the value of your current laptop/camera and your £1000 camera/laptop is only worth fraction of that year later)"
FTB - Home Insurance,nano-moose,1,"Thanks! My laptop and camera are both >£2000 (camera worth more to me personally as laptop I wouldn't mind replacing with something cheaper), so for the next year at least I think it's worth insuring those, laptop will probably decrease in value after that tbh so maybe I don't insure it after. I'll continue comparing prices though to see if I can work out something cheaper"
FTB - Home Insurance,jacekowski,1,"If you really want to insure your camera, get separate insurance for it. You really do not want to claim on your contents insurance as single claim can easily add £1k/year to the premiums (and claim on building/content insurance has to be declared forever so it will hurt you even 20 years down the line), it's very rarely worth it to claim for things that cost less than ~5k to fix.

Also, they don't care about how much camera/laptop is worth to you, but what is the market value of a 1 year old camera."

Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,badger6789,128,"Lmao

There's always one post that reminds you that you haven't seen everything with regards to a landlords antics.

This is their responsibility to sort out end of story.

It's their house and as such it's up to them to fix anything that breaks.

It looks like they may not have insurance and as such is going to cost them a fair wad. That's not your problem though.

You should tell them it's their responsibility to maintain the fixtures and fittings and under no circumstances will you be taking responsibility for this."
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Wonder_8484,19,"The landlord would insure the building and laminate is considered part of the building. The carpets are contents insurance.  However, the landlord should have bought add-on contents insurance. (sometimes it is not included)."
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Substantial_Basil538,20,"The landlord is responsible for this repair, not you. If it can be proved that you caused the leak through negligence / vandalism etc then you would be responsible for the repairs (the cost, not arranging the works).

Keep writing to the landlord explaining the defect you’d like them to rectify, refer to your inventory / check in report if you need to. If the landlord puts up any more resistance you need to decide if you’re going to put up with the floor, or move out. 

There are ways to enforce repairs but it’s a massive headache."
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,OberonDM,9,"I had a similar disagreement with mine - leaking bay window caused black mould under the 5 year old carpet - Found when they demanded I redecorate after previous damp course work. Naturally that was not staying, so I took photos, sent them to the estate agent and removed the carpet immediately. It pretty much crawled out on its own, the amount of mould that was underneath. 

Long story short, a year later the estate agents are still harassing me monthly to replace the mouldy carpet, claiming it’s my responsibility since I removed the carpet without permission. Since then they’ve had to replace the whole floor as it was caving in due to woodworm. Still being told to recarpet, as now landlord ‘is thinking of selling’ (nothing to do with getting round the 6 month ban on evicting me since the council is now involved….) Told them to get stuffed. Council also told them to get stuffed. 

Landlords. It’s like their common sense goes out the window when they get the keys to a rental."

It’s not your problem and you shouldn’t be paying for  it, even if you caused it which you didn’t it is 5 years old at a minimum you would be liable for a tiny fraction of the new cost.."
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,kipkapow,2,"Hi, I’m a landlord. It’s our responsibility to change the floor, not yours. 

For example, my recent tenants have just moved out. I’m about to get new ones in and I didn’t like how the flooring looked in the kitchen as I didn’t feel it was up to standard. I want my tenants to be proud of their home so I changed it."
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,WolofBomberg,2,"I work in Home Insurance dealing with claims (have done for 5 years), and it’s not quite as cut and dry as everyone here is making it out to be. It actually all depends upon your tenancy agreement.

If your tenancy agreement states that you are liable for any and all damage to the property and making good regardless of cause, then unfortunately it is down to you to sort this out (whether you are insured or not).

With regard to the laminate, a content is generally defined by most insurers as something that could reasonably be deemed something you could take to your next property (the example often used is; if the house was turned upside down, anything that fell would be a content - with the exception of carpets, which are always deemed a content unless glued down). So, if the laminate is not glued down, and does not go under the skirting, it is a content.

As to what is insured under contents, most policies come with “Tenant’s Liability” cover, which covers you for damage caused to your landlord’s buildings and contents if damaged by an insured event (in this case the event is referred to as Escape Of Water).

If I were you, I’d go back to my tenancy agreement and check what you are liable for. I hope this helps 🙂 I promise we aren’t all evil in insurance, just most of us 😜"

Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Anthelios50,1,I hear ya. I actually think I came across a post of yours about that before when I was first looking up issues with flooring in rented accommodation. Bet you're glad to be out of there!
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Anthelios50,2,The floor needs skipping too 😀
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Anthelios50,1,Interesting. Don't suppose you have a brand or name for this type of laminate so I could see if it might possibly be similar please?
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Anthelios50,1,"The floor is definitely more than 5 years old at any rate, it was far from pristine and perfect when we moved in. It's just deteriorated quite badly since then."

Let me know what yours says. I mentioned to the estate agent that the new carpet in place of a 5 year old one would count as ‘betterment’ if they tried to take it from my deposit as they threatened. Her face was a picture when she realised I actually knew the score there."
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,[deleted],1,Quick step
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,[deleted],1,You owe them nothing they are taking the Piss
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,kipkapow,2,"I look at it like this. The better I maintain the property, the better the tenants will treat it and I’ll get quality tenants which causes less headache."
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Anthelios50,4,"Yup, private landlord"
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Anthelios50,1,"To be fair, they did fix the leak promptly, it's just the issues the leak has subsequently caused to the flooring"
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Anthelios50,2,"I think you're bang on the more there, I couldn't agree more!"
Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,kipkapow,2,Mmm the leak has probably had a knock on effect. I had a bad plumber who put a nail into a pipe which caused a slow leak and caused the ceiling to rot. It was expensive but had to be fixed. They’re just delaying the inevitable.

- Set up royal mail redirection, no matter how organised with changing addresses you are, there will always be stragglers.
- Get a the removal firm's packing service if you can afford it - I can't recommend this enough! I have seen so many people struggling with the packing and realising they own a lot more than they thought, packing taking days/weeks and then manic on the day of the move... If you use a removal firm's packing service, they usually come a day or so before the move and pack up the majority of your stuff in a couple of hours, then pack the remainder on the morning of the move, I've never seen packing done so quickly and efficiently! Plus they should rebuild any flatpack furniture they've packed, saving you the job. It saves so much hassle and stress, totally worth the fee in my opinion!

- Clean everything! And I mean everything - cupboards, drains, walls, floors, windows... 
- Plug in the fridge, unpack a few kitchen essentials.

Introduce yourself to neighbours. 

Program the thermostat to your preferences.

Make a list of snags you want to fix before bringing in the heavy furniture. Go thoroughly every square inch. Any small paint jobs, plaster work, doors, windows, flooring, bedding, etc. You probably already did this but there's some stuff you only notice after being there for a week.

Day 1 in your new house,[deleted],8,"Yep, I’m due for exchange tomorrow but found out my mortgage provider has asked for an additional valuation report last minute, so there’s a good chance that if they don’t come back today, I’m not exchanging till next week.

Day 1 in your new house,liptastic,1,"I don't know how people have the energy and the time for the clean on the first day. Both times we moved after a purchase, we finished around 7-8pm after working (packing last minute bits, managing movers, packing the car, making sure the old place is presentable) the whole day plus stressing about completion and getting the keys. By the time the movers left we were so knackered we just ordered a takeaway, set up the bed and went to sleep"

Oooo door mats! That’s not been mentioned. Going to add that to my list"
Day 1 in your new house,Head_Serve,3,"Your advice is actually the one of most underrated comment here :D It is not fun to start to assemble the bed at 2am after a long and stressful day :D Especially, since probably you couldn't sleep from the excitement in the previous couple of days :D 

I'm telling this from experience :D 

The icing on the cake was when I finished around 3.30am went to take a shower only to find out I had only ice cold or extra hot water as the plumber mixed up the 2 pipes...

But at least the next day we found out that the whole bathroom is leaking around the bath (new built) LOL."
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,3,I can already imagine myself being exhausted then having a little breakdown because I can’t just get into bed 😆😆😆😆
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,1,Yes I’ll make sure to do this. Thank you!!!
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,2,"I will be heading this warning. I struggle with fatigue and the thought of moving day….nope 😆 luckily my wonderful partner has said he can do all the loading and unloading with a friend and I will be designated cleaner as I am so keen at the thought of giving my new lovely home a deep clean (aren’t we the stereotypical couple) lol. We’re taking the week off so we can enjoy and take our time, plus I wouldn’t be able to concentrate anyway"
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,2,"Other way round, I’ll deep clean and he can do the lock stuff, but yes I get the sentiment haha. 

BREAKFAST! no one else has mentioned that!!!"
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,1,"Royal Mail redirection I had not even thought of so great tip! 

We’ve already started packing because we live in a flat and the white goods etc don’t belong to us so we thought ‘let’s do a bit here and there, won’t take long’ and I have quickly realised we have accumulated a lot of rubbish 😆 the only benefit is we are actually getting rid of a lot of clutter we just don’t need, instead of paying someone to move stuff from a-b. We’ve half filled the spare room with packed boxes and you honestly look around and wouldn’t even think we have started, there’s just so much stuff ha"
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,1,Yes wil make sure the front facing windows are covered

Then start painting the livingroom"
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,3,Noooooo we paid cash. Not getting it financed. We’ve literally been so careful not to miss a payment on anything or get in a single piece more then what we already owed
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,2,No one has mentioned either of these. I think I might look at key rings now 😆
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,2,Lucas Furniture ☺️

Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,1,Don’t need to tell me twice 🤪 spent so long not spending any money I’m looking forward to splashing out. I’ve been buying little kitchen bits to keep my spending cravings happy
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,1,I’d get that on a T-shirt lol
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,1,Ah ok thanks for letting me know. I’ll make sure to have it in place. How stressful. I hope it doesn’t burn down
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,2,Oooo is that a superstition! Will make sure it’s all moved on the Friday
Day 1 in your new house,Still_Soft6969,27,"Seems like you have things planned out, which is great. Just wanted to share my experience as I’d not wish that on anyone. Enjoy the experience when it’s all done and dusted though!"

Day 1 in your new house,littlenymphy,4,"This sounds like my nightmare, the last thing I want to be doing in my new home is having to clear out someone else’s shit. 

How did you end up dealing with this? Did you have to go back to the seller and give them the chance to come and collect it or did you just get rid of it?"
Day 1 in your new house,FootballAndBicycles,6,"We had the freezer turned off, with a pack of burgers still in there that had been there for months since turn-off.

Pure mush that had to be re-froze before we even dared to scoop it out"
Day 1 in your new house,missionred,7,"Just to not worry you too much. 

The sellers of our first home cleaned everything so well that I don't think the house has been that clean since. They even left a card and a bottle of champagne. 

Everyone's experience is different but Reddit threads seem to attract a disproportionate amount of negative experiences."
Day 1 in your new house,AdSingle455,2,"Time pressures of moving out can make the loveliest of people cut corners! At the very least be prepared that your refuse bin is overflowing cos who has time to do a tip run on the last day! Also, dirty marks everywhere, furniture against walls will do that which is not visible until the roof is empty, we bought a 5 year old new build which looked pristine when full but was a horror show when we got the keys. Nothing that a quick coat of paint couldn’t fix but every room needed painting which we hadn’t counted on"
Day 1 in your new house,SoftFirmHardware,2,"You could always try phoning an order in if you are still kinda close, sometimes just eat setup isn't exactly the same as where they will actually deliver.

Also if you order direct they aren't getting mugged off by just eat fees..."
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,2,YES I need to do this. I sent a meal to my previous address on a food app I hadn’t used for ages. Luckily it was my mums house 😆
Day 1 in your new house,EdwardSpaghettiHands,3,Woohoo! Added bonus!
Day 1 in your new house,No-East-7380,1,"Have some sort of opening. I prefer the door as if I was a ghost I wouldn't want to jump out of the window lol. Start in the middle of the house working towards front and back doors and then line the base of the doors with sage. You don't have to go nuts as it's just a silly superstition, a couple of supermarket bottles did my 2 bed semi. Some people like to burn the sage to penetrate the house but I didn't want to make the smoke alarm unhappy."
Day 1 in your new house,SpannaMonkey,10,🖕🏼🖕🏼This! My parents in the 80s found 2 bags of porn mags left up there 🤣🤣
Day 1 in your new house,martanimate,3,"Also that! We found a giant teddy bear in a black bin bag. I wouldn't even know it was up there, except we had to get up to the loft to survey damage from a hole in the roof (luckily it wasnt big)."
Day 1 in your new house,jdoedoe68,2,Wilko and DunElm are your friends :).
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,4,"Oh no what a nightmare!!! 

I’m worried about the sleep. I get very internally stressed or excited and the slightest thing will give me the worst nights sleep."
Day 1 in your new house,everyoneelsehasadog,1,Haha I recommend getting your meals for moving day and day after sorted. Find the nearest greasy spoon so you don't have to wash up
Day 1 in your new house,spacedgirl,1,"Ah yes, definitely declutter - I should have put that in first :D  Though we had a huge declutter and still seemed to have loads of stuff haha!
The removal firm was amazing - I think because our whole move process was very stressful due to various issues, it was such a relief that the packing/physical moving was not stressful at all. The moving day felt far more in control and we could finally ""relax"" 😆"
Day 1 in your new house,MistyLifty-,2,Priorities durr 🤣🤣
Day 1 in your new house,frostycab,2,I’d introduce myself to my immediate neighbours and see what happens. Some villages are so nice that they’ll take you down to the local for a pint and introduce you to everyone. That’s what happened in the last 2 my sister moved to. Don’t be disappointed if they don’t though.
Day 1 in your new house,hypocrisyhunter,3,Ah good. It's horrible being in that situation being scared to spend a penny or use a credit card. Have been in that position for 6 months now waiting for my chain to complete
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,10,Sorry that happened to you. I’ve been so stressed through the whole process. Will just be glad when exchange is done and I can sit back and relax lol why is buying a house so stressful ha
Day 1 in your new house,[deleted],3,"Thanks, turned out okay in the end, all good for tomorrow!"
Day 1 in your new house,dxonxisus,3,"we tried. we basically went back to them and said “look, this isn’t good enough. we stated clearly multiple times that the flat was to be cleared out completely” but they just argued back and essentially refused to do anything about it.

in the end it was easier to just wring our hands clean of them and just dispose of all of the crap ourselves and move on. still very frustrating to get to the flat after picking up our keys and see all that"
Day 1 in your new house,FinanceAddiction,2,"Tried that, they refused :("
Day 1 in your new house,Crazym00s3,1,"I didn’t make this mistake with food, but I did with a bunch of Amazon parcels the first time I ordered. And my warranty replacement nest thermostat ended up there months after I moved 😂"
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,3,"I’ve got a sage stick for burning, maybe I’ll be brave enough to give it a go. The house was build pre 1900 so must be a few people hanging around. Just hope my nans up there making sure no one scares me, she knows how I am lol 
Ok I’ll get all the doors and windows open, just give them the option"
Day 1 in your new house,mr_catbert,4,"Erm.... I said crap 🤣

I found 30 years of empty boxes for shit that had long since been thrown away!"
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,3,Ooooo doubt I’ll get this lucky
Day 1 in your new house,No_Kick5206,3,"Also for fun to see how much the house has changed after decorating it since you first bought it. A friend of mine made a photo book of the restoration of their house, it was a really sweet memento of their hard work"
Day 1 in your new house,Head_Serve,1,"Just take it easy, it isn't a question of life or death, try to enjoy every minute of it :D"
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,1,I’ll probably go round on the Saturday or Sunday then and say hello. They might come out when we’re movingZ that would make things easier ha
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,1,Probably been one of the worst things about moving is the fear of ruining it by doing something silly
Day 1 in your new house,CountryBumpkn22,2,This is such a cute idea!!! I’m going to do that
Day 1 in your new house,frostycab,1,"Good idea. It’s so easy to fall into the habit of just giving neighbours a nod when you see them and never really chatting or even knowing their names. As long as they’re not an utter nightmare it’s usually beneficial to become friendly, and in a village setting you don’t really want to feel like outsiders."

House insurance after exchange,itallstartedwithapub,2,"Normally there's an option on comparison sites to say you haven't moved in yet, that should cover it. You could add on contents later, but it's often cheaper just to do it together and accept you have unnecessary cover for a few weeks."
House insurance after exchange,Departme,2,"Don't stress too much about it. Start it the day before exchange. Contents insurance is usually a few £ more so go with that. I got buildings/contents cover (sky protect) through compare the market. It's £12 a month.

Send it to your solicitor as soon as you get it. Then it's done. Move on."

Who's responsibility is house insurance?,lcmtech,13,"The usual split for a rental is that the owner would insure the building, and the renter would insure their contents. Worth noting that if there's a mortgage on the property it likely has a condition that the owner has buildings insurance. "
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,ljm3003,8,Why would you pay to insure a house you don’t own? I’m staggered that your parents would cancel their policy without checking
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Flashy_Disaster1252,7,"Owner gets building insurance, renter would get contents."
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Lower_Possession_697,3,"It's the owners responsibility, and it's their financial problem if anything goes wrong without cover. Though it might also be yours if the house becomes uninhabitable that insurance would cover.

But setting aside the rights and wrongs of it, as they're your family perhaps you could save them from their own foolishness and take out a policy anyway? If they refuse to pay you back you can take it out of their Christmas and birthday presents."
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,pictish76,2,Landlords/owners normally deal with the building side and if you are moving out they would be better doing it.
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,TallTangerine3873,1,"The owner should have landlords insurance and the tenant should have contents insurance. 
It may be different if the tenancy is more informal, but that’ll be for you and your parents to discuss. "
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,rmas1974,1,The landlord is responsible for buildings insurance and you for contents.
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Takemetothegarden,1,Thank you for this info. The mortgage has been paid off but that's good to know!
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Alarming_League_2035,1,"Owner definitely needs the building insurance, if you had it as a renter, and something happened.. you can happily walk off with the insured amount and leave the owner with a pile of ash/ rubble and zero money, they're being foolish not having it."
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,TheFirstMinister,1,"Your folks are not being smart here.  It's their gaff, they need to insure the structure.

You need to insure your own contents."
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Simplyfabulous29,1,The owner/landlord has the buildings insurance and the tenants do the contents if it is an unfurnished property. If it is a fully furnished let the owners/landlord also needs contents insurance. If it is partially furnished both the tenants and the owner/landlord would have contents insurance to the value of their furnishings.
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Takemetothegarden,2,Thank you. The mortgage has been paid off already so I don't think this has impacted it in the last few years.
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Takemetothegarden,2,They aren't the savviest when it comes to housing but yes I agree.
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Takemetothegarden,1,Thanks for this info. I am happy to take it out I just want sure about responsibilities surrounding it!
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Takemetothegarden,1,What would happen if they just did regular buildings insurance and not landlords insurance? It is very informal which on one hand has been beneficial but we don't have a tenancy agreement or anything so I have a feeling they won't want to take out landlord insurance.
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Takemetothegarden,1,"Yep, makes sense.

I have let them know we can't get insurance as we don't own the property so the ball is in their court currently! I hope now they know they will sort it."
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Lower_Possession_697,3,I guess just carefully check the policy wording / Ts&Cs in case you have to be the owner to take out the policy.
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,TallTangerine3873,1,"Presumably still fine, as long as the building is covered. Structural issues can be expensive to repair so it’s always best to be covered.  

 Just as an aside, not sure who your quotes are with but we recently paid £128 for an annual buildings and contents policy. (on a 3 bed semi) 

Edit: formatting and spelling. "
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Takemetothegarden,1,"Yes I think you do have to own it to take it out... I'm happy to pay it, it probably just needs to go in their name."
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Takemetothegarden,1,"Thank you! My partner said that if they just do regular buildings insurance and state that this is their primary residence to do so (which I think has to be the case) it could void the policy if anything did happen... so we are at a bit of a standstill I feel. 

I think the quote might have been high as I put us as renters and it's perhaps an unusual situation, only two quotes were offered too whereas for car insurance etc they usually have loads of options."
Who's responsibility is house insurance?,Lower_Possession_697,1,Sounds like a good way forward. Fingers crossed you don't get hit by any meteorites (or other unlikely scenario) before you get the policy in place!

Claiming an insurance when loft is missing a B reg,itallstartedwithapub,3,"I'm not aware of any cases where an insurer has successfully refused a claim on the basis of missing building regulation approval alone, where the property was otherwise structurally sound prior to the insured event occurring. Insurers can't rely on arbitrary criteria to avoid paying a claim, unless those criteria are specified in the terms of the insurance.

The opposite has happened though. There has been at least one case where a claim was refused because a homeowner insured their property as a 3-bed instead of 4-bed, with the owner claiming that the loft conversion didn't count because it wasn't signed off as a bedroom. The refusal was upheld by the ombudsman and the claim was not paid."
Claiming an insurance when loft is missing a B reg,scot-mod,1,"It shouldn't be advertised as a 4-bedroom. For the purpose of selling, it's a 3-bedroom, with a handy extra space in the loft, but all you can say about this space is that it is extremely over the top boarded loft space and is only really suitable for storing things in. 

Of course, you can use it for more than that - I'm sat in my loft room with no building regulations right now typing out this message on my computer. But I didn't pay for a 4-bedroom house - I paid for a 3-bed with an additional loft room. From that point of view, I view the house as being a bit of a bargain, although I will have to try and deal with scared buyers when it comes time to sell it on.

In terms of insurance, there is a lot of puff online about building regulations and insurance, but very little substance to the claims people make around it. As the other comment says, there is only one real case you can point to, and the claimant was definitely at fault for underinsuring their house.

So, in a nutshell - pay 3-bedroom money for it, insure it as a 4-bed and you'll probably be fine."
Claiming an insurance when loft is missing a B reg,SmellyPubes69,1,"Another case here where someone claimed it had 5 bedrooms (not 7) because no building regs for the 2 upstairs so they couldn't be considered bedrooms. Fire gutted the place and refusal of insurance was upheld. (Link below)

Moral of the story - insurers are more concerned about fact, not arbitrary council rules.

How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,Joooooooosh,2,"1. Contact the landlord agency and tell them what has been going on and that it is completely unacceptable. No one has the right to enter your home. You are renting the flat, it’s not a hotel. The agency has no automatic right to have a master key or access the flat without your permission. Give them a chance to fix this issue or respond. 
Make it clear they are breaking the law and you feel unsafe and worried about your privacy being invaded. 

2. Make a complaint to your local MP and or council: https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/complaints

3. Buy an extra lock or replace the lock to secure your property. Doesn’t matter what the tenancy agreement says, you have the right to secure the flat. It’s not their flat to manage access to, it’s yours. 

4. Make a log of all the illegal accesses made to other flats. Get written evidence from the other tenants, with dates and names, so you have a body of evidence that can be confirmed via CCTV or witnesses. Always useful to have this rather than just hearsay.

If the agency get funny with you, presenting them with a list of illegal accesses will most likely shit them up and prove you are organised and not someone they can bully. 

Officially complaining to the agency is the right first step. It gives them a chance to address the bad behaviour. Keep pushing to try and find a senior person to contact. Most likely, the lower level people are just shit at their job. A senior manager would shit the bed knowing this is happening. 

If you ever find a contractor in your flat. Immediately demand a years rent refund. 

If they do not fix the issue. Contact your council and report the agency and change your locks. Perhaps fit an extra lock anyway, just a latch so no one can get in when you are home.  "

Ask them to supervise a contractor visit to your flat. Alternatively restrict access to the building friendly handyman.

I suppose you live in one of these gated ghettos for safety so it’s easy to feel threatened. The main issue is unauthorised access you don’t need to over justifying a stance.

If something did go wrong you would have no recourse as build to rent operators act via agents and their agents. They would wash their hands of any problems. Hence the suggestion to allow the handyman access."

It's a flat, not a hotel. I'd be livid with this.  Obviously they could give you a section 21 for not passing by their shitty rules, but whilst that rule exists, that could be the case for wearing socks your landlord doesn't like the colour of.


Maybe wait a couple of weeks, something may happen with the new government. But you legally can change locks.


This is so wrong, on so many levels and the fact that you are there as your safe space and you have no idea who is entering your home is making me angry. This shouldn't happen to you, it really shouldn't. "

You are in the minority here most my clients over the last 20 years simply gave permission, it is incredibly common for trades or those that work in rentals.

How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,pictish76,0,"She has yet to give a straight answer on that like many things.  The use of master keys is common in large blocks, even modern smaller ones we get them all the time, it has been for the 20 years I have been working. Any large development like hers will use them including halls of residence and student accommodation. 

You can safely assume if you are told that tradesmen will be entering your property between x times on x date and you have not said do not come they will be coming. We frequently have people who change plans so are in, have to deal with people who don't tell flatmates and in students cases we don't even bother with early appointments any more as half the time they are still in bed.  I very much doubt that people who are living in s block that is being fully updated would not have notice and that a company that owns a 250 property block doesn't know the law. It is perfectly normal for tradesmen to have keys to enter properties,  The bulk of our work happens in properties when the tenants are at work as trades work 9-5, so no tradesmen having keys is not abnormal. 

The issue is whether she was given notice and the rest of her tales are anecdotal, you may have notice she never actually says she was not given notice,  but she has neglected to mention this is not a normal yearly occurrence, she was supposed to move out last year as they were doing a full renovation, there is not enough yearly checks for tradesmen to enter more than 3-4 times every few years as many safety checks are not yearly, so no she is not being truthful here and the case of contractors giving random people they met master keys is laughable, you are on the hook to change every lock in the building if you lose a master key that can run to 10s of thousands in large buildings. So thats one hell of a screw up by a contractor and I can't see how a contractor mistook her for the building staff."

They do have a right to arrange to inspect and or carry out repairs, etc. But again, the tenant must be notified and can then agree a time.


All these things they are checking, they know they need checking at certain times, they aren't emergencies.


If OP leaves her tap on and goes out, that's reasonable for the LL to enter, because it is damaging a property below, as well as her own. I'd say that is serious enough to warrant entry without permission. Checking the boiler, smoke alarms, electrical installation, CO2 monitor, etc, isn't.  These things need to be checked periodically, it's known in advance they will need checking.


I don't think it's a police matter, as such. It's common law, right? It's trespass, not by the contractor, but by the LL, even though they are not the one entering. They instructed and gave permission for a contractor to enter the flat, they had no right to do so.


I don't think the contractor is the one facing down the barrel of the law here, they are unlawfully being granted permission. Completely on the LL or their agents."

How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,pictish76,-1,"The op has conveniently not said once whether they have given notice, or whether she has objected ,which is a tad weird as this was a major renovation project for the entire building  she mentions she was aware of , they actually asked her to leave for it. She couldn't due to another issue and asked to keep her flat on throughout the project.

This isn't just people doing the safety checks there is nowhere near that many in a year, they are actually renovating the entire building.

If they are entering random flats using a master key with no notice or permission it certainly is a police matter. The rest of her story is totally anecdotal doesn't involve her flat. Jesus I have been doing this 20 years , I have people walking around naked, bondage gear, in the shower, half the place in bed, sparked out stoners everywhere, herds of staffies, cats , sheep you fucking name it. Not everyone remember s they have someone booked  to come round, but as long as they have had notice and the notice offers them the option of saying no, the notice is legal and they have implied access. The thing with the keys is bizarre anyone who works with master keys knows the liability of handing them off to the wrong person or losing them can run to tens of thousands in large buildings, so I bet that guy got reamed."
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,pictish76,0,"I most certainly do, you don't understand the implied right of access in both the landlord and tenants act and your contract for repairs. Nor have you understood how the notifications I am talking about work. 

At no point have I said they can just turn up without correct notice or that you can not refuse the appointment or that they can let themselves in without informing you 

Your notification will give you the opportunity to remove the implied right of access, it will inform you if keys will be issued if that is acceptable and it will give you the opportunity to rearrange.

It's an entirely common way large companies deal with flat inspections and for example management companies doing safety checks where there is several hundred properties at that location. It's not really viable for them to get individual consent for every person. Not how I work when dealing with clients but some companies certainly do this."
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,pictish76,1,"I suggest you go read the full judgement and all areas ruled on, I literally just quoted the relevant part, just because a case is about one thing does not mean precedent is not set for others. That is what allows no changing locks without permission clauses in contracts as the landlord holding a key has not removed the enjoyment of exclusive possession, exclusive possession is required to use quiet enjoyment for preventing entrance. This is coupled with the housing act law which clearly states a landlord can hold and use a key and enter their property in emergencies . 

 So yes changing your locks when your contract states otherwise without good reason( for example if the landlord or agent is causing issues which then is covered by quiet enjoyment) would breach your contract, both by preventing the landlords legal right to enter in emergencies, or his right to hold a spare key for that purpose. This would also make you liable for any forced entry required and any excess of damage by you preventing a quicker response.

Changing your locks without permission should only be done in cases such as locking yourself out, lock failure, immediate security issues or if the landlord or agent continue to perform unreasonable actions. As well as if there is nothing in your contract.

The right to quiet enjoyment is not an absolute it requires parties to be reasonable, there are multiple ruling where access has been granted by courts and the tenant can then be held liable for costs."

Implied access is how this works as it does in all these blocks when given notification of intention to carry out work, I frequently work in blocks like this and get issued master keys, so no unless the op has been reasonable or even asked them to stop she has no case. These men are contractors its how we work. All she has done is imply that they are entering homes without permission. So the security issue is nonsense.

The landlords duty is to minimise disruption under right to quiet enjoyment and to give reasonable notice, if they are doing this and has not said no more visits when I am out or at all she won't have a case. Normally there would be some financial reparation during the work period to make up for it, but as she specifically requested to stay in the property instead of leaving at the end of her contract knowing this was going to happen that may not be the case."
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,Acceptable-Sun-6597,2,The way you work as a contractor getting into people’s homes without their permission doesn’t make you nor whoever employs you in the right. There are laws. She can easily call the police for you and the management and get both of you in trouble. Tenants statutory rights are above any contracts and any tenant has the right to stop any innovations etc if it’s disturbing them. It’s the tenant decision not yours. In this case the company can choose not to renew but even this may unlawful eviction. I think this thread has many landlords who are unaware of laws or trying to scare tenants
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,Acceptable-Sun-6597,0,I am cautious with words. The landlord doesn’t need to give “notice”. They need permission unless it’s an emergency like a flood or gas leak etc. The word “Permission” differs from “notice” obviously.
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,pictish76,-1,"You really don't know what your talking about so should stop, I am not a landlord, I literally do the job, if I turned up without the person receiving  any notice of the visit which includes consent to enter if not replied too they could call the police. This is exactly how every agents visit or contractors visit works. I think the thousands of solicitors who act as letting agents actually know what the law is. A tenant on receiving the notice can refuse it or change it to a more suitable date but until they actually do that there is implied access using spare keys, unless they have specifically said no to visits when they are not present for any reason, pets for example being a common one, that will be listed on their file.

You are absolutely right a tenant can refuse any repair or renovation unless it is an emergency one as a landlord or their contractor does not require permission to enter in that case.- That is the law. However they have to actually object to it first before taking any action like changing locks . It would most certainly not be unlawful eviction if a tenant refuses to co operate with a landlord over repairs especially if health and safety is involved and a section 21 requires no reason. It would also not be unlawful eviction if your contract states do not change the locks and you do that before taking reasonable action like saying stop visiting."
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,pictish76,0,"The notice comes with implied access, so if you don't object or ask for another date they have permission. It will be in the notice. This will certainly be the case where a block this size is being renovated, it is not really viable to phone round 250 people to get permission.

Like I have said if they are not giving notice or entering randomly out with the period they have said they should be working they are wrong and changing locks is a reasonable response, if you say no and they continue to enter, then changing locks is reasonable both of those would fall under right of quiet enjoyment. Both of those cases would be the Landlord not taking reasonable steps to prevent unwanted intrusion, the same as if workmen constantly block your access or make excessive noise or mess."
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,Acceptable-Sun-6597,0,There’s no difference in tenancy rules between renting one flat and renting 1000 flats. The landlord has the same duties and the tenant has their exact same rights. The tenants obviously in this case didn’t consent to the timing of access and master keys are mishandled and left to random people. It’s very clear they can change their lock but I would call the police and send a warning to the company for future reference
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,pictish76,0,"Where exactly did she say she did not receive notice? Or told them to stop, the tenant in this case has not exactly been truthful about the situation. Its not very clear she can change her lock as she has not even said she has asked them to stop entering her flat. What is she going to tell the police? My landlord said they were sending someone round I didn't object? The contractor is legally allowed to enter. The master key situation is worrying but also bizarre I take it she was at the front desk or something and they thought she was the concierge staff. I can't think of any contractor just randomly throwing key's at a stranger they met in a hall, the liability cost for a large block runs to tens of thousands."

Re flooding we have the groundsure report showing the house as having a high risk of surface water flooding. But we’re also not sure how to take this as the map is years out of date not showing phase 1 or 2 of the development and not including all the things the developers did to mitigate the flood risk that allowed them to build the houses in the first place. E.g the map shows a large pond down the road where phase 1 is that has been houses now for 3+ years."

New Build Insurance,Smart_Bulb,1,For ours the developers insurance covered the building until completion so we only needed insurance in place from the completion date.
New Build Insurance,_ProfessionalGoogler,1,Ah thank you that might be worth a try for us. We’re buying one of the last homes on the development so phase 1 and 2 have been around for ages so they should be able to work out a quote from them

Losing our home,Excellent-Bass-855,156,They can't evict you without a section 21.
Losing our home,Large_Ad_2834,26,"The notice that you have been given verbally does not mean anything. An eviction notice must be given in writing and they cannot backdate. Usually a section 21 is 2 months but this can depend on other factors such as how often rent is paid. Usually a landlord cannot refuse you to have a pet without reasonable grounds, and as you already have a dog, I’d say he’s being a bit unreasonable. That said, if he wants to rely on a section 21, this is a non fault eviction and so whether or not he is being reasonable is not relevant. I would stay in communication with him and try to work towards a solution (paying more/rehoming the dog as you suggested) and try to avoid an eviction. But at this stage, you have NOT received a legal eviction notice (I have assumed you have an AST and your landlord doesn’t live in the same property as you)."
Losing our home,okaybutnotho73,12,"Just want to chip in that this situation may not be all on you, it may have simply made the landlord consider their own options - a lot of landlords are selling up because the maths is no longer working for them. If you are added to the tenancy agreement that is another 6months minimum AST (depending on arrangement) commitment from both sides. Totally agree with the advice on asking the landlord to pop over for a cup of tea and chat. You both seem like good tenants from what you have written, and good tenants are worth their weight in gold. (The posts suggesting waiting for court eviction is totally the wrong way about this, and another reason many Landlords are pulling out of the market) keep it fact based, and if you do find they still want you to move, request your S21 and check all the details on it. S21 is two months."
Losing our home,More-Caterpillar-63,35,"If the agreement doesn’t mention dogs and the landlord was previously aware that there was a dog, I’d recommend that you reach out to Citizens Advice (or equivalent) as I don’t think they can evict you. 

This may have been a knee jerk reaction on part of the landlord. Send a polite communication re-affirming that there’s already been a pet in the property (if they were aware, if it was hidden then don’t rub it in) and that the property has been well cared for while you’ve stayed there. Perhaps highlight the measures you’ve taken to secure the animals. You could offer to pay an additional pet deposit or that you’d be happy for them to check in on the property for their piece of mind. 

My best friend worked for a property management company- the state people with animals could leave the place in traumatised her. Faeces seeping under flooring and into the baseboards, urine and literally chewed walls and doors. It’s a nightmare to get the smell out if people aren’t taking care of pets. If they have a bit of reassurance that you aren’t going to be like that they’ll maybe reconsider, but it might just be a tactic to get you both out so they can charge more for rent."
Losing our home,IceDragonPlay,10,"Did the landlord issue an S21 eviction, or just told you verbally to leave? Verbal means nothing. 

Were you formally added to the tenancy yet? Or is this a case where a person and a dog was added without the landlord knowing ahead of time and they are frustrated? Possibly suggesting a new contract with a slightly higher rate of rent would calm them down?

And lastly, in order not to get kicked out, perhaps you should re-home the new dog so as not to mess up your partners rental and reference from this landlord."

Losing our home,JeremySpoons,1,"If you haven’t received a letter, you haven’t been served a notice. They must serve a s.21 in writing (assuming that is what he said on the phone). A verbal notice is not a valid notice. Once they serve a written notice, contact your local council or Shelter to check its validity, as even a written notice isn’t always valid. 

The only way you can be formally evicted is via a court, which will take months, and you have every right to remain in the property until the day you are evicted, however obviously the risk in this is the potential court costs and also landlord harassment, depending on the landlord. A lot of landlords will pressure tenants to leave, especially when the s.21 expires. It can be an incredibly stressful situation, so best advice is to start looking for options now but not to just leave when they say, they have to follow the process correctly and from what it sounds like, without a letter, they haven’t even started this."
Losing our home,Inevitable-Slice-263,1,"Are you absolutely sure the land lord will not budge on this?

Is it possible you could say to the land lord that you are really sorry you assumed another dog would be OK and would be open to have frequent inspections to reassure them you are looking after the place.

Emails and telephones just don't have the same effect as face to face.

*Then you have not been served a valid section 21 notice and the 8 weeks has not started*. A Section 21 can only be served in writing, and it must give adequate notice (normally 2 months once the fixed term has expired, though there are various niche exceptions where they'd have to give longer and a very small number where they could give less).  

There are also various other hoops the landlord has to jump through before they can serve a section 21 - for example they must have protected your deposit in a valid scheme, they must not have charged you inappropriately for anything, they must have given you the property's EPC, an up to date gas safety certificate, and so on. If they've not done any of these things, they cannot serve a Section 21. [Details here because it varies depending on where you are](https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices).

The notice period only begins once a valid notice has been served. And it's very much in your interest to delay that as long as possible. So, if they don't serve a valid notice, don't tell them they need to! Wait until they realise - and if they don't then only tell them a week or so before the deadline they've set (which buys you another ~50 days). If they serve a notice but any of the stipulations in the link I sent aren't met, same applies (they'll have to re-serve it and wait another 8 weeks), and so on.  

One thing to consider also is the possibility of a Section 8 notice. This is an alternative procedure where the landlord could evict you for various niche reasons, or your failure to pay rent or meet your contractual obligations. If your contract stipulates no pets, for example, they could claim you'd breached that term (though you could potentially reasonably argue that they'd waived that term and evidence it with any correspondence referring to you having pets before). A section 8 is riskier for a landlord because they have to prove to a court that the grounds are valid - and can very easily go either way. Whereas if a *valid* section 21 goes to court it should be assumed that you'll be required by the court to vacate.  

EDIT: In any case, continuing to negotiate would be in your best interest at this point. Emphasise that you don't see how a second dog materially changes things from the previous situation because you already had one, tug on heartstrings by explaining how the dog was previously mistreated, etc etc. I wouldn't volunteer additional rent unprompted, but you could offer to increase the value of your deposit. Don't admit or accept that you've been dishonest or have breached any contract term, especially not in writing. If your contract doesn't mention pets, make clear that you notified as a courtesy and had no obligation to, and are extremely concerned by the response. If you've been good tenants generally, question whether it's really worth the risk of rolling the dice by evicting you and perhaps getting problematic ones next time."

I think this sub often duhamanises landlords which is why all decisions to the tenants detriment seem worth lashing out for. But actually a lot of landlords are pretty normal people who for one reason or another have a second property. There's no need to hate them all.

I have a spare property and if I could actually make any money out of it I would let it. But it's not really worth the bother. What does that mean? Does it make another property available to live in?

The main thing I've been discussing with my Broker and other people is that while I can easily find some providers for even 200GBP with all these things included it seems to realy be about the quality of the provider in general, their payout rates, how fast are they to answer and help etc etc

This is where I am finding the biggest struggle, naturally the broker has vendors they'd prefer to use but additionally the specific person I am in discussions with is very honest and it's really that you get what you pay for. 

One of the biggest examples of this I can use an example is the Solicitors for my FTB which is in process like yours, I found quotes for very cheap but decided to go for some pretty pricey lawyers but they have been absoluelty outstanding and I think I get replies within minutes of any question I have or any updates, they have a brilliant app that has a live status of whats being worked on I do alot of the paper work in the app. Where as friends of mine who went the other way said it was painful. 

I had the same deliberations with Life Insurance, Income protection, Critical Illness cover as to even if I need all three. (I really wish this was discussed at a school or uni level) As I never even thought about these until my broker spoke to me about them.

My broker also wanted to me to take out life/income/critical illness cover but I decided against all of them.

>What extras are you getting for twice the price? Or are you in a risky/floody area or something?

From what I can see on the quote accidental, home emergency and legal cover. They also have pretty low voluntary and compulsory excess's some of the compulsory ones are half of what some of the big providers are.

But the 400GBP is really what got me questioning the suggestion from the broker so trying to do as much reading of the IPID as I can to see if there truly is a benefit to the extra. Also this evening planning on looking at the reviews online a bit more."
Do you pay for home insurance Extras like legal cover or accidental damage cover?,OwlBebula,1,"In terms of what I am doing to compare the providers I am trying to find all their IPID documents. This should go into a fair bit of detail about what is and isnt covered.

Some of the key ones that vary for example are tracing and accessing leaks, some may find and stop the leak butt thats it, while others will repair damage caused by the leak (IE if if then leaked downstairs and ruined your wall).

Another one I've been looking at is the compulsory excess's as they do seem to vary. Some are like 1000GBP for a leak whereas others are 250, then there are rather large, differences for theft some will have a minimum that you need to declare 1,500 or more whereas some are 4,000 or over.

So really I am trying to find the provider who looks like they cover the most in terms of it anything goes wrong, has good reviews, a good defaqto start rating, has all the extras and in somewhere from 250 to 350.

Just it's a lot of legwork, I should have done the same for my Life, Income and Critical illness insurance but it all came out to like 80GBP a month which I had budgeted for anyway so felt it was fair especially as the price is now locked in for life.

I've been very thorough in my research with regards to the main ""product"" I'm buying ie. the house itself (its structure and upkeep, the various survey results, maintenance and getting trader quotes ). and that has been incredibly time consuming. I'm also onto my second house in 5 months as well since the first one fell through. 

So I just hadn't had the time to look into insurance policies very much although I usually like to do my research. I think I'm just going to grab the insurance products that seem to broadly make the most sense this time around and when it comes to renewing in a year's time, I'll do more research. Of course this might turn out to be a bad approach as I don't really know all the problems of the house yet (despite all the surveys) and so many things could break in the first year. So in fact I might do a bit more research inspired by your example... I found out today that we have yet another delay in the run up to exchange so I have the time now 🙄"

How much do you save towards housing costs?,WelshBluebird1,8,"5k for a new boiler sounds a bit ott, and I'd also say emergencies like that are exactly what an emergency fund is for!

As for other costs, you have general upkeep and redecoration, things like kitchens and bathrooms needing to be redone over the years, roof maintenance and repairs (though if you are leasehold maybe that is taken care or for you) and that kind of stuff.

I think the usual figure banded about is 1% of the value of the property per year, but obviously if you live in a particularly cheap area for property that may not be enough and it may be ott if you live in an expensive area."
How much do you save towards housing costs?,No_Row_3888,2,"We don't have excessive insurance (buildings and contents, car and travel) but our £230/year for boiler and heating cover is money well spent I feel. The yearly service that includes is worth about £90 too.

We moved in 5 years ago and have had one basically full boiler rebuild (would have cost over £1000 in parts excluding labour). Plus we have relatives who ended up with what would have been £1000s of repairs to just their hot water cylinder.

We could afford to pay for that all out of savings but I'd rather not have to if (when, no doubt) it goes wrong again. There's not many things that could cost you as much as a boiler or heating repair so worth insuring for me"
How much do you save towards housing costs?,carlostapas,2,"The general rule is 1-3% depending on building type and age.

Work out the cost and expected lifetime for each and annualise it for your house.... Then add a bit extra for unplanned issues like leaks, repairs etc"

£90 would go on an annual service anyway, the insurance essentially costs us £140 (£12/month) which I'd rather pay than a big bill. With a new boiler and cylinder you'd be covered by the manufacturers warranty anyway"

Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,[deleted],2,"It's buildings insurance. You don't need the contents until the house actually has your stuff in it and indeed you can't be insured until it is.  Check with your solicitor. Since I don't think you will be paying the service charge before completion, you might need/want a couple weeks of buildings cover (your lender would usually require it), but your solicitor will know.  Don't rely on them to bring it up- you can check with one quick phone call.

If the boiler breaks before you move in, then unfortunately, you'd just need to get it fixed. Try not to fret about it though. You can't control things that closely.  You could visit at 3pm the day before completion and it might still break at 4.30."
Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,raininfordays,1,"It's building insurance not contents as you don't own the existing contents. Also you don't legally own the building yet either - you've just commited to buying it from exchange regardless so your insurance covers anything that happens between exchange and completion at which point a regular policy should start.

If something big were to happen you'd go through your insurance. If the seller is insured, the ins co would try to get them to pay but they're not required to be insured at that point and/or may not have the level of cover needed. Either way, it's for your insurance to sort (so make sure you get a good policy). If it's small things usually you'd just eat the cost and fix/replace as the claim would end up costing more."
Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,the_reptile_house,1,"If you're getting any of the existing contents with the sale (e.g. you mention carpets) and you are worried about possible damage then you could get contents insurance. You don't have to do this though, and it might be expensive with you not living there during the two weeks."

Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Worried_Patience_117,3,Why are you paying insurance on a leasehold house via a landlord?
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,rmas1974,2,Yes.  The offered price for the freehold is extortionate.  The value of the reversion in 1869 years is negligible and the only true value is the net present value of the £12 ground rent which would be under £500.  Could assert rights to manage and insure the building yourself so the insurance bill is excessive also unless there are high risks of some kind.
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,joobjoobfriend,2,"You must read the terms of your lease and who it makes responsible for insuring he property. Purchasing insurance via the freehold is inefficient as they will often inflate commissions and receive a kick back. You are able to ask what commission % is paid on the policy and there is recent spotlight from the FCA and ensuring fair value for leaseholders. If its anything more than 20% then arguable it is unfair. Your cover also sounds highly unusual being fire peril only, this is not common at all and poor value. I would seek out insurnace quotes online e if you have the time and use that to ask why the freeholder arranges such expensive and limited cover."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,jacekowski,1,"You need to work out value of 460k in 1869 years (to work out reversion value), with pessimistic (for you) values it will be approximately 0, then value of ground rent, again worst case scenario, 2.5k, some legal costs on top of that (for both sides, 1k-ish each) and you should be somewhere around 5k (and that is the pessimistic variant)"
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,"Because the landlord says it’s a legal requirement. They are required to insure the properties they own against a minimum of fire cover. My neighbour stopped paying the landlord when she got her own insurance much cheaper, and when she went to sell the house they made her pay all the backdated insurance before she could sell."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,"Thank you. I think they are being very unfair with their insurance provision. They are creating an unreasonable price because they have used a house value figure (provided by their surveyor) that is 3 x the market value (the usual metric for an insurance policy quote) of our home. In our purchase of full home insurance we provided the market value as required as the standard metric. In order to be protected by the legislation designed to protect leaseholders from ridiculous insurance policies like this, I have to meet the requirements of the landlord too - they will bat me off with ‘you have not insured it with an adequate rebuild house value’ - even though we have provided the standard market house value as is required. It’s very much a David and Goliath situation - the same family own most of the town. We can’t afford to challenge them, so see purchasing the freehold as a way of freeing ourselves, but even in providing a freehold quote they are brutal in their valuation! I can’t wait to be rid of them because the insurance and now the freehold are daylight robbery."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,Thank you
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Longshot318,6,Presumably your lease stipulates whether or not you are required to pay an insurance contribution to the landlord?
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,joobjoobfriend,2,"The value should be based on the reinstatement value (what it would cost to rebuild) and not the market value. This should be calculated by a professional rics qualified assessor and then there is no room for disagreement. I would definitely get some quotes online and show these to your landlord as evidence their terms are poor value. I would be more concerned that your cover only includes fire only. What if you have a major pipe leak or lightning, or malicious damage etc."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,RedditB_4,4,"You can’t hold different insurance policies on the same building. 

Absolute nightmare. Imagine the legal bickering if there was a fire and you had 6 different insurance companies all trying to worn out of paying anything by apportioning blame.

The freeholder is likely taking the piss with extortionate insurance rates.

He’s definitely taking the piss with his lease valuation. Thousands of year plus £12 ground rent = worthless. He knows it too.

He just wants a piece of the uplift you get if you secure it.

The process is arduous if go hostile for it so barter him down. Couple of grand plus his costs seems reasonable considering you’ll get roughly 1%+ on your value and increased saleability.

Just be sure to start a sinking fund if there isn’t one and you can self manage for extra bonus points."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,2,"Just checked the original lease which makes for an interesting read! It states ‘And further that the Lessor will during the said tern insure and keep insured the said messuage out-buildings and appurtenances and al other buildings (if any) which shall be erected upon the said demised premises agains loss or damage by fire in some Insurance Office in or near London for at leas three-fourths of the value thereof for the time being such value to be determined by th
said Surveyor’."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,"You’re right, I remember reading that. So what I should have said is that the rebuild is usually less value than the market value, so for our landlord to triple the market value to arrive at a rebuild value was so off the mark to everything I was researching re: value required for insurance purposes. And if we included the other risk storm etc they wanted over 2k. So we included everything in our home and contents for far far less, but they require us to have at least fire with them. Nearly everyone I know in this town has two insurance policies because of this landlord."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Longshot318,3,"You are correct about not having more than one insurance policy but the lease will stipulate whether that is to be taken out by the freeholder or the leaseholder.  This obviously relates to buildings, not contents insurance."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,2,"I told the landlord insurance rep that I am extremely uncomfortable with ‘doubling up’ on insurance, because the irony was that for our home and contents it was cheaper overall to have fire included in the cover. I asked him what would happen in the event of a fire and he said we’d have to use their insurance - it is ridiculous especially as he is only able to offer building fire and storm damage insurance, so everyone has to buy further insurance to cover contents etc and effectively end up ‘doubling up’, but he told me ‘buy the freehold if you’re not happy’. I agree that saleability is a huge plus of owning the freehold, not least losing the hefty landlord insurance bill! The landlord owns most of the town so it feels very much a David and Goliath situation…"
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,RedditB_4,2,"We had a live in freeholder once and she refused to insure the building despite the lease starting it was her responsibility.

Not much we could do. The flat owners weren’t organised. Didn’t speak much. Typical modern day life thing. 

To make matters worse the freeholder died soon after we acquired the place and our attempts to pick up where we left off organising the whole mess with her children fell flat. They were money grabbing little s**ts and the old lady had left behind quite the bag.

Tried taking us for 30k each for a freehold that was worth £0. It has nearly 950 years left to run at £20 ground rent per year with no provision for it to rise. Hardly investable.

Had to play hardball and force it from them and the tribunal set the price. I felt they were overly generous at setting the price at £300.  Worse still we’d offered £2k per flat plus their costs as a gesture of goodwill.

Greed people. Learn to see when you’re the guilty party and don’t be blind to the law when it’s an emotive issue. These kids (all in their 60’s) felt they were due more despite having it spelled out to them that they weren’t.

I didn’t lose any sleep."

"How much of a red flag is ""flood zone 3""?",nickyb198,14,"It all depends if the building was built to consider the flood zone or not. For example by me it’s flood zone three and new builds have to have all habitable floor about a certain height so the risk of it flooding is pretty slim. Also consider what the building is made from, if it’s timber and the height hasn’t been considered then I would walk away. If it’s been properly design to accommodate the risk of flooding then I can’t see an issue with it.

(Alternatively some engineering consultancies offer flood risk assessments for conveyance and insurance purposes.)

Key thing would be trying to judge where the flood map outline sits versus your property and the elevation difference.  If it’s flood zone three then it will be flood risk greater than a 1% annual probability so unfortunately it may be substantial.

"How much of a red flag is ""flood zone 3""?",eerst,2,"OP I think you are getting some odd advice here. A huge proportion of London is in flood risk zone 3. Entire boroughs are practically in flood risk zone 3. You can get insurance. Otherwise there simply wouldn't be people with insurance in huge areas such as Fulham, Vauxhall, Lambeth, Rotherhithe, Canary Wharf... You need to call around for insurance. Of course you also need to be comfortable with the risk. With climate change, if the Thames barrier ever reaches, you will probably be flooded. That is just going to become a fact of life for a lot of people in the future. Certainly if the house is made of wood, I would be somewhat concerned about this. I might be less concerned if it's made of brick or concrete, although admittedly I'm not an expert on this topic whatsoever. But I think I want to emphasise the point that you are certainly not the only person in London in this situation.

"How much of a red flag is ""flood zone 3""?",cobalthedgehog,2,"You can get specialist homebuyer flood surveys if you’re unable to put your concerns to rest through cheaper research methods. This would involve a specialist surveyor assessing the specific risk to your property and recommending mitigations, plus giving cost estimates for them. I considered it for a property I looked at but didn’t end up going ahead with it. It will cost £1500-2000 probably, but I think it can be worth it in some cases. If I weren’t getting any quotes for insurance then yeah, that’s a big worry. A scheme called “Flood Re” may help you if you can’t find any quotes through the normal methods."
"How much of a red flag is ""flood zone 3""?",MissWin94,2,"I've recently discovered that flood zones have recently changed as they now take into account climate change, so it's possible this area is still unlikely to flood. Many authorities don't want you building on flood zone 3, I've had a project abandoned because they wouldn't budge on building on land in zone 3 (even when including design for flooding). I personally wouldn't buy in zone 3, but as you're not ground floor your personal risk is somewhat low. Although it sounds like you've already discovered getting insurance might be tricky."

The sellers told us it has never flooded, but that the river level had come up to within a few inches of the threshold back in December 2011.

Ended up buying another house kinda nearby but went back there during the highwater earlier this year and glad we walked away from it. It didn't flood but again the water was less than an inch below ground level.

Funny thing is that the Environment Agency map only had it as a Cat 2 Flood risk because the topography relief lines weren't accurate enough and the property was on the hill side so on the map they figured it was a few metres higher than it was IRL."
"How much of a red flag is ""flood zone 3""?",MustStayCalm,1,"Smart move.

With climate change I do think things will get worse before they get better.

The point about insurance is that living in a high flood risk area is probably going to make insurance more expensive and/or harder to find. And that will no doubt be reflected in an ever increasing service charge.

So while I do appreciate suggestions for how I could still get contents insured via specialist Flood Re, that's not very reassuring for me."

The property is close to the River Brent.

Checking out elevation at that location on a topographic map, it sits at 33m which hardly places it on high ground. The scale on the map goes up to 54m: https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-np4z4/London/?zoom=16&center=51.56281%2C-0.26306&popup=51.56295%2C-0.26305

The house is still for sale and they haven’t reduced the price.

Agree with flooding getting worse. It seems to me we don’t get rain like we used to, but when it does it cokes down hard in a short space of time. Flash flooding and it’s gone in a few days. I would say if a property has previously flooded, give it a wide birth!"

The Scottish home report is much stronger than the RICS Homebuyer Survey in England which is usually paid for by the buyer and commissioned after an offer is accepted. Internet searches tend to prioritise the system in England and Wales which may have given you the erroneous impression you need to do more surveys?

Process of buying a house in Scotland (no chain),glorious_sunshine,1,"That sounds reasonable. Did they accept?

Second viewing before instructing solicitors?"
Process of buying a house in Scotland (no chain),GordonLivingstone,1,"You can make a formal offer via your solicitor - but ""subject to survey"" as part of the offer conditions. If there are no other buyers in the offing then the seller may agree to accept your offer with that condition. 

An informal offer will not get the house taken off the market so if someone else comes along with a firm legal offer and less onerous conditions then the house will be sold to that person.

Bear in mind that, if there are a number of interested parties then a Closing Date will be set for receipt of final formal offers. The buyer will then pick the best offer. Normally that will be the highest offer but if he has two similar offers then he may well go for the one that is not subject to survey - and many buyers will rely on the existing single survey.

There is a lot to be said for trying to get your offer in before a closing date is set. That lets you negotiate with the seller as opposed to making a blind bid. However, it has to be a bid that is attractive enough that the seller prefers to take rather than wait for multiple offers.

If you really want the place then it may well be best to get your survey done quickly then quickly  put in your offer in the knowledge of its outcome.

(The seller provided  Single Survey came about so that buyers would not have to pay for multiple surveys for failed offers during sellers markets.)

If you have a good solicitor then he/she should be able to guide you. Normally they don't charge until your offer is accepted.

I remember buying my first place forty years ago and being warned by my solicitor that I had to have everything in place and any surveys done before making my formal offer because, if it was accepted then I was committed to buy.

Thinks are a bit less certain now because of the number of conditions being placed on offers but the expectation still is that you will buy the house after having your offer accepted and you won't pull out without good reason (like problems being uncovered by the legal searches.)"

I’ve just moved into my first rental apartment! What do I need to do?,SomeHSomeE,2,"Take meter readings as soon as you move in.  Then find out who supplies energy already (gas and electric may be separate) and phone them and tell them you've moved in.  You'll then be able to either stay with them or shop around for a new supplier.  


Council tax go to your council's website and they'll have instructions on how to register for council tax.  You'll have to register everyone that lives there - usually you can do this and sort out payments all via the portal but some councils might still need paper forms.  


Water it depends.  You may be on a flat rate or metered.  There'll only be one water company supplying your area so you can contact them and find out.  


Bins should be on the council website how it works.

Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,royalblue1982,5,"Hi,

The key thing is that there isn't a major rush to get things set up. The water will keep pouring, the power will stay on, the council won't send the 'men' round. Especially if you have a month between buying and moving in. 

Don't underestimate how long the moving process takes though, even from a furnished house. You need to pack everything up, move it to the car, drive to your new place, uppack, come back and repeat multiple times. As well as this there will be regular trips to throw stuff away, and then you have to clean everything. 

Also, be prepared for how much all the 'small' stuff can add up to. I've spent about a grand just on things like bedding, kitchen stuff, small bits of furniture, fittings to put the tv up, bins, pillows, paint, garden stuff etc etc. Though, you can always buy stuff slowly. 

Don't forget that your car insurance might increase when you tell them you've moved. You'll probably needed to pay council tax for both properties for that overlap month (actually, if you have single person discount you can only use it for one of your properties, so it might be more than double your usual payment)."
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,annedroiid,4,"> Mortgage

It really depends on the lender. Often they won’t take any payments the first month - both times I’ve purchased the first payment was 1 1/2 months into me owning the place. 

> Council tax

You should look up your borough to see if you can notify that you’re moving in, but regardless they should send a letter to the occupier within the first month or so with an account number. You go online and tell them when you moved in and they will pro-rata the bill from that date so you’re only paying for the time you own the property. This can normally be paid via direct debit on a monthly basis. 

If they’re slow you may not pay this the first month, but you will still have to pay for that time. 

> Water 

This one I’m not sure of if you have a meter as I’ve always been in unmetered properties, hopefully someone else can help you here. 

> Gas and electricity. 

Similar to council tax if you don’t contact them they should send you a letter within the first month introducing themselves and asking you to create an online account. Given you have smart meters you don’t need to give any readings, although I’d still take a photo of the meters on move in day in case something has gone wrong in their system. 

If you’re on a pay monthly plan they’ll suggest a direct debit amount that’s 1/12th of what they estimate you’ll use over the year. In summer this should mean you’re in credit as you use less energy over the summer than over the winter, which should then reduce as you get to winter. If your credit starts building up significantly you can ask for the DD to be adjusted and/or for a refund of some of the money you’ve paid. It’s quite common for their estimations of how much you’ll spend to be a bit off, but it is expected that your DD amount will be higher than you current monthly costs given that we’re going into summer. 

In terms of when they’ll need to be paid, they’ll want the first payment within a month of you moving in. Depending on what date you set the payment for this could be within days of you moving in or it could be almost a month down the line. 

> Broadband

Worth noting it can take a couple of weeks for a free day to set up the broadband, so you likely won’t have it immediately upon moving in. Similarly to gas/elec you can normally choose a day of the month you want to be charged, and they’ll just charge you on the day.

TLDR: Everything is going to be payable (barring possibly the mortgage) within the first month. For everything you normally get to choose what day of the month it is, so it won’t be a surprise to you.

Only other thing I’d suggest re stuff to set up immediately is a mail redirection from your old place to your new, to catch any documents you forget to update your address on. Most important ones being banks, DVLA and the electoral roll.

Edit: One more thought - if it’s a leasehold how the service charge is paid is completely up in the air. Some places you pay monthly, some places want it paid a lump sum once a year 😳"
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,NoJuggernaut6667,1,"The only things I have on my list that you haven’t mentioned is writing a will and having a full clean done on the new property. Both aren’t “requirements” pending situation, and the latter is there based on how the place is left (I’m expecting to need/want it)"
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,No_Reaction9432,2,"Thank you! I will set up the mail redirection, I had forgotten that. 
But basically in terms of regular costs I should budget for regular bills and up to a double mortgage payment.
Then anything else which comes up, that's harder to predict I suppose 🙈"
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,No_Reaction9432,2,"Yes writing a will is important, I haven't done that yet but I will get on to that promptly. The house I'm buying is in good order. Of course I'll clean it and shampoo carpets before I move in but it doesn't look like I'll need the help of a professional. It is in good order"
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,annedroiid,2,"Basically yeah. It’s good to have an emergency fund for anything that breaks like the boiler, kitchen appliances etc too. You may not need to do any repairs like that for years, or you could be incredibly unlucky and have a bunch of stuff break quickly, you’ll just never know."
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,NoJuggernaut6667,3,"Yea like I mentioned it’s a personal preference. Personally the last thing I want to think about when stressfully moving is spending a whole day doing a deep clean, but this will be a toss up between your value of money / time in the moment"
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,No_Reaction9432,2,"I have a 6 month emergency fund which I hope to keep for big emergencies like unemployment or illness. I should have a few grand on top for things like the boiler. The house is less than 10 years old and the survey all looks good. I guess the boiler might need replacing in the next few years. All the appliances will be bought brand new so should last a few years at least. It's just scary, I feel like I have prepared as well as I can but I'm still stressed about it all"
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,No_Reaction9432,3,"Thanks, yes it is a balance. I could afford to pay someone but as I'm moving from a furnished rental the house is going to be empty so there'll be a waiting period before the  deliveries start arriving so I will have time for any cleaning"
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,annedroiid,2,"Sounds like you’re well prepared then! I agree it can be quite overwhelming, there’s just so many things you need to set up when you first move. After you’ve been in for a month or two things should settle down quite a bit and go back to normal."
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,No_Reaction9432,2,"Thank you, I'm buying alone too which is entirely a choice, I wouldn't really have it any other way. But it does add to the stress a bit!"
Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,annedroiid,1,"One thing I’d suggest is make a document/spreadsheet of all the things you’re doing this time pre/on the exchange, completion and moving days. Then next time you’re doing this you already have a list of all of the things you need to do/update. We’ve just purchased a place for the second time (and sold our old one) and it was fantastic already having a list of all the things I needed to update.

The list I made of all of the companies that have my address was particularly useful, so I didn’t forget things like our English heritage/national trust membership, or the various subscriptions we have for household items from places like who gives a crap or bower collective."

How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,error23_snake,18,"I think only £100 for electric is very optimistic.

Does the £70 for petrol include your car tax and insurance? You'll also need to save something every month to pay for MOT/service and tyres etc.

You've not allocated anything for clothing. Or going out e.g. gigs, restaurants. Or haircuts/beauty.

You'll also want something set aside for home improvements, so you can add/change furniture and decor.

Plus you'll need a decent amount in savings that is ready to use in case of home emergencies and repairs (boiler breakdowns, leaks, white goods breaking etc)."
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,alwaysahermit,8,"Is your flat a leasehold? If so make sure you budget to include any management fees/ground rent. 

If it’s a share of a freehold then you’ll likely need to consider what other maintenance costs there will be. Which will include buildings insurance. 

There is not an awful lot left over so make sure you carefully factor in any other annual costs you have such as annual car costs as well as other ad hoc expenses.

Do you have an emergency fund? If not I would look into building that up with whatever you can put away for savings. 

Good luck with the move!"
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,alex_alexs28,6,"Your bills will be higher for this one bedroom flat, as I have one but not exactly the same. I can relate a few things to you.

The water is high, but more or less accurate. Affinity Waters are charging me £220 every six months - £36 a month. You could check with your provider to maybe have it metered, as I am now in the process of doing so. 

Your internet bill is accurate but for high speeds. Minimum 500 mbs you should get for this price, as a new customer with Virgin Media but through 3rd parties websites - like uSwitch or MoneySuperMarket for example. I am paying £36 a month for 18 months for the M500 package.

I am not seeing the service charge there, which usually is significant too. My one is £627 a year.

FULL electric will mean a lot more than £100 in the current circumstances, I would add another £50 at least to it. In the times you will be heating, will be even more, again, under the current circumstances.

Potentially ground rent but this seems to becoming a thing of the past, so hopefully you won't have to pay. As an example, I had to pay £10 for a year, to the council, the freeholder.

You may have a life insurance. My one is £12 a month.

You will also have the car insurance, along petrol.

When you first move, it's most likely that you will be buying some things around the flat. 

A frugal life may be needed for a while, to be able to save something as an emergency fund, if you don't havevit. An example, I had to claim with my insurance for the car, and I had to pay the excess for this. This was an unexpected event.

Congratulations on your flat. Enjoy it!"

How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,TheAwayGamer,1,"Will probably get a water meter if possible. I can manage if electric is £200 a month. I believe the current people there were paying about £80 in summer months and £150 in winter.

Food. I buy cheap like Aldi/Lidl but nothing is cheap anymore anyway!"

Sign up through an affiliate link to get £100 (something like money saving expert Cashback) then set up your own virgin media referrals account and refer yourself.

I do that whenever I’m up for renewal and end up getting £200-£220 just for that."

How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,[deleted],-2,"Honestly I'd love to know why! 

People ask an honest question and I give an honest reply and I'm always up for expanding on things if requested."
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,ForestBluebells,1,"I pay around that but I’m on an older tariff and I have a heat pump for heating. £200 should be doable if you are mindful of your usage. 

Food annoys me as I really don’t think I’m wasteful but can’t ever spend less than £200 a month, I spent £350 this month!"
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,TheAwayGamer,2,Oh yeah I know sorry didn't mean forr it to come of rude. Just crazy how high electric is now compared to previous years
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,NekoZombieRaw,1,"I'm wondering how your gas and electricity is so low. I was a sole occupant in a flat and never had the heating on, and spent more than that!"
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,ameliasophia,1,The insurances part is a bit worrying. Insurance is barely anything per year and it's always been worth it for me
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,TheAwayGamer,1,wow. Where abouts do you shop and what sort of foods?
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,[deleted],1,"Insurance is a massive earner for the Financial Service Sector.  Many of those huge shiny biilding in city centres, such as London, were paid for entirely out of the profits from insurance, (after rich shareholders took their cut).

Insurance, when you beak it down to its most basic steps is simply gambling.

(1) Pay money up front
(2) Depending on a random act of chance you may be quids in... but most often you lose your 'bet'
(3) The 'House' wins more than it loses or it wouldn't be on business.

So, if you've got more out of Insurance than you put in you are, factually, in the minority.

Most people, if they totted it up on their deathbed, will have paid out a fair bit more on Insurance premiums than they ever got back. That's why it's so lucrative and why it's pushed constantly whenever you but anything.  The problem is most people are financially illiterate and think Insurance is some lovely 'favour' that benefits them.

Source: I worked in the Financial Service Sector, mainly on Insurance products. It turned me off wanting anything to do with the massive con that is Capitalism."
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,ForestBluebells,1,"Asda or Aldi. I had a lot of top up bits this month making it more as I buy big packets of washing tablets, dishwasher tablets, toilet paper etc. I don’t buy anything extravagant I think the cost that adds up is snacks. If i want to spend less then no snacks for me :("
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,ameliasophia,1,"I disagree. I’d say the gamble is choosing not to have insurance because if something does happen and you can’t afford to pay it you’re basically fucked. 

Insurance is about spreading risk. For example with car insurance, the cost of a car accident can be disproportionately high and Can be a lot higher than the individual at fault’s ability to pay. So everybody pays a little bit each year so that those who need the money due to bad luck get it. I hope you at least have car insurance. 

I had an insurance payout of £15k a few years back when a neighbours pipe leaked into my property. I’d never have been able to pay that myself. My mum also had an insurance payment of a few hundred thousand to rebuild her house when it was destroyed in storms like 10 years ago. I sleep better at night knowing that for a few hundred a year I’m protected from bad luck."
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,TheAwayGamer,1,Oh no I love snacks... I think my cost might run up a bit.
How do my bills seem for a 1 bed flat?,[deleted],1,"Your opening line acknowledges that it's a gamble. Agreed?

You're buying peace of mind. I get that. That's the business model that's marketed.

... but statistically if you took 1000 people most people lose over their lifetimes than the lucky ones like you who claim more than they put in.

Source: I worked in a senior management position in the City. My role was to advise the board members of international banks, primarily through my being accountable to sign off the 1yr, 5yr and 10yr business cases on such things as insurance products.  Insurance is a gamble that preys on the weak willed... and it LOVES a good tale such as yours to keep the cash rolling in! :D"

Buildings Insurance Help,itallstartedwithapub,5,"Flat roof - make your best estimate based on the plans. Use the material that covers the largest area.

Address - ""haven't moved in yet"" is normally an option. Where are you looking, on the usual comparison sites?

WFH - clerical use only / no visitors

Pets - answer honestly. The question is ""do you have any pets?"" not ""do you want any pets?""

Contents - you probably won't be able to get contents insurance until post-completion. Most policies will allow you to add it on later."
Buildings Insurance Help,treeseacar,2,"If you can't accurately measure you can only enter your best guess on how much is flat roof. If two roofs are different materials you may have to call and ask. 

You need to insure the property from exchange so you'd normally select that your address is the same, as from exchange you pretty much own it. But it shouldn't really matter. 

Most insurers don't count office work as business use but you'll have to ask if it's not clear. 

Pets if you don't have one it's obviously a no and you update later if you get one. It's usually relevent to accidental damage claims if you have a pet. 

Contents and buildings insurance is generally cheaper if they are bundled together unless you have specialist items."
Buildings Insurance Help,Esmay89,1,"Thanks, really helpful.

I managed to find the planning app for the rear extension online which had the 2 side and rear elevations drawn to scale which I used to get a rough idea of pitched vs flat roof area. No idea how truly accurate I am, but I got 28.5% being flat so i'mma drop it to ""up to 30%"" instead of the ""40%"" I put on my original comparison search.

I figured I was delaying the inevitable and was just going to stress about not knowing stuff (massive over-planner here) and just did the dreaded 1 hour wait to speak to the insurer. Your reply was pretty much accurate to what they told me :)

The address thing... It was one of the comparison sites that threw me. At the end it asked if the contact address was the same as the insure address, it's currently not, and when I said that they asked why with specific options like ""second home"" and ""living abroad"". Not bought yet wasn't an option so I assumed I did something wrong, as insurance before completion is commonplace. I probably just mis-understood the question. I'll call the insurer back when I need the policy in place and explain my situation, they can make sure it's entered correctly.

Thanks again for your help."

Found out about an unresolved insurance claim (subsidence) on the day of exchange,ShineAtom,25,"Given the recent floods my town has suffered which were far, far worse than the last lot 16 years ago, I would be extremely wary of buying anything which has a remote chance of flooding.

I'm assuming based on your original post you're also in an area with less stable ground...

Found out about an unresolved insurance claim (subsidence) on the day of exchange,audigex,2,"It’s possible that it was applied to the wrong property, or that the previous owners fixed it without going through insurance but their insurer still has it on record as unresolved

Alternately it’s possible your sellers are aware of an issue and were hoping you wouldn’t find out

Either way the solution is the same: wait for your solicitor to do some digging and then, once you know the reason, decide whether or not you still want to buy the place

Fortunately you found out before exchange, that’s a huge bonus in this scenario - it’s not ideal to back out but at least you have the option

Personally, though, I’d run a mile. Subsidence is NOT something you want to mess around with, and if there’s a previous insurance claim (even incomplete) then you may find your own policy wouldn’t cover it in future. A garden repeatedly flooding is a common cause for subsidence"

For a little context, the house in question is built up probably 5 feet higher than the garden, and another 2 feet down to the brook. The neighbour said that in 2007 it would've been probably half the way up the steps to actually get into the house itself, and that's the worst it's been (which is similar for a lot of places). 

I would still be fairly confident that it's unlikely to suffer actual flooding into the house itself. But I am also aware it's an ever changing world."
Found out about an unresolved insurance claim (subsidence) on the day of exchange,MrBish95,8,"Correct. Bought together, have since split up and moved on (from what I'm told). No onward chain, they just want their money out.

The next door neighbour said that in 2007 (which was the worst flooding they've had), the water would've been approximately half way up the steps to the back of the house.

You can request a copy of the policy from the freeholder and they have to provide it within 21 days - do this first to check that what you're claiming for is actually covered.

How to rent with a dog,Reesno33,16,"At the moment their is a much higher demand for rental properties than their are properties to rent so land Lords can pick and choose who they want so why would they choose to rent to someone who's animal might cause damage, smell, make the next Tennant allergic, bark and annoy neighbours when they have a stack of other applicants to choose from with no pets?"
How to rent with a dog,red_00,6,50 quid extra a month turned my 'no pets' landlord into a pet friendly landlord. That was about 3% extra on the asking rent.
How to rent with a dog,Wonder_8484,3,"I can understand why landlord don't want to take on pets, because there is little help when there is property damage. They can't ask for a higher deposit, as limited to 5 weeks."
How to rent with a dog,internetpillows,3,"In the past I've had success with private landlords taking pets by offering certain assurances, usually when a landlord says ""no pets"" it's not set in stone and you can try to negotiate. Things may be harder in England, I'm in Northern Ireland and our rates of dog ownership are the highest in the country so a lot of landlords are more OK with dogs.

Assurances include offering a pet deposit on top of your regular deposit to cover any potential damage, or agreeing to take out your own contents insurance (you should anyway) with pet damage cover (most insurance doesn't cover pet damage). I wouldn't offer increased rent unless they say no to all of that, usually a pet deposit is enough to convince someone if they are ever going to change their mind.

It can also help to explain what breed your dog is, landlords are far more likely to agree to a nice calm family dog like a Labrador over breeds with bad reputations like a pitbull type breed. It can also help to give them a character reference for your dog, as silly as that sounds it actually helped me once to have someone else verify that the dog had a good temperament."
How to rent with a dog,anxiousFTB22,3,"I’m in SE London and I’ve just found a property to rent with my small dog. It’s a small house, not a flat, which I think is part of the reason for my success. But, while I did find it tricky to find somewhere decent with the market so competitive at the moment, there were more landlords accepting of dogs than I’d expected.

I was up-front about my dog with all of the agents I registered with (I registered with most in my area) but found that they generally weren’t particularly proactive about contacting me with relevant listings. I arranged most of my viewings just by proactively responding to Rightmove listings as they popped up. In these scenarios I generally didn’t mention my dog because I wanted to do as many viewings as possible to get a feel for the market. I tried to view pretty much all of the 1 and 2 beds being listed in my search area but skipped anything where the listing explicitly said no pets - there weren’t many of these. I suspect when I called most agents didn’t check the notes on my profile and so booked me in for viewings regardless but I did have one or two agents turn down a couple of viewing requests due to the property not being pet-friendly.

I recommend checking out OpenRent as you deal directly with the landlord and their listings say whether they’re pet-friendly or not. You can also set up an email alert for your search criteria but beware it only comes through once a day by which time all the viewing slots may be taken so it’s best to keep checking the site directly through the day. I always included a bit of info about me and a positive description of my dog, e.g. small, friendly, quiet, neutered, vaccinated, goes to day care, etc, whenever I sent a viewing request on OpenRent and I had positive responses back every time. I viewed 5 dog-friendly properties through them and all bar one were decent, although unfortunately none were quite right for me.

It took me 3 weeks of intensive searching (26 properties) to find my new place. Mainly because there are a lot of poor quality properties on the market at very high prices. But I think about 50% of the ones I viewed were dog-friendly. The house I found was listed on the high end of the price range for 2 beds in the area so I offered £100pm under asking and I included a positive bio for my dog. I still think I’m overpaying a little but but I also think most places expect more from a tenant with a pet."

I've seen the damage pets costs by poor tenants, and that what it is. It's less about the pet but that actual owner so it's not their fault.

Courts dont favour landlord either so if you did thousands of pounds of damage then landlord would need to go to court. The court can but a repayment of like £5pw for a £1000s of damage for example.

I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Big_Target_1405,57,"In the beginning buying is way way way more expensive. Stamp duty, legal fees, maintenance, furnishing, decorating, can be extortionate...

However, buying gets cheaper over time, month to month, as you build equity and pay less interest on a smaller remaining balance.

Renting gets more expensive over time as your landlord cranks up rent, often by a default contractual 5%/yr

In theory you pay no maintenance when renting,.but often you have to put up with a 12 year old boiler and a kitchen thats falling apart that your landlord has no legal requirement to replace.

Personally, I'd rather rent and invest but the numbers don't stack up long term. Even if renting were cheaper, investing the difference for decades probably wouldn't get me to a sum big enough to pay rent or buy a place in retirement, and I'd have to pay tax on those investments"

I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Philluminati,10,"A young person wants an iPhone so they go to Ee website. Here I can get an iPhone 14 128GB for £80pm with an upfront fee of £30. At the bottom of the screen it says each March the price goes up by the CPI + 3.9%. The plan is 24 months long, so the cost is roughly

    30 + (80*12) + (80*12*1.039)
    £1987

The rich person buys the iPhone outright from Apple for £1029 and buys a SIM card only plan from EE for £36pm. Same 3.9% increase applies.

    1029 + (36*12) + (36*12*1.039)
    £1909
  
Buying the phone outright saves you £78. However if you don’t have £1000 you have to choose the more expensive option.

Renters have to pay rent increases and be bullied by the landlord. When the whole market of landlords are bullies, switching doesn’t scare them. Once you escape the poverty of renting you can reasonably drive costs down."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,SomeHSomeE,6,"Buying has a lot more up-front costs.  But remember, your monthly mortgage payments are a combination of interest (a cost that just goes to the bank) and capital (money that is paying against an asset you own so is not 'lost' money).  Rent, on the other hand, is 100% cost.

My place, for example, my monthly mortgage payments are £1200, of which £1000 is paying capital (so still my money) and £200 is interest (so a cost).  Renting it would cost £1900 a month, and all of that goes to the landlord.  So that means buying costs me £200 a month but renting would cost me £1900 a month.  But there will also be places and mortgages where the rent is lower than a mortgage payment - even then it still might be better financially to buy, but you'll have less cash flow for monthly expenditure as everything going towards your mortgage capital is locked up in property and not money you can spend.

There are some scenarios where renting can be better, financially.  This would normally occur when house prices flat-line or decrease, and stock markets (where you'd otherwise invest your money if not invested in a house) are performing well."

Home ownership is not the silver bullet many people perceive of it as. I have presently lost money by buying a home because my previous ""mates rates"" rent from a friend's dad was much cheaper but it was also not sustainable to live like that forever.

I am now ""locked-in"" to staying here for a few years unless I want to swallow all those one-off costs with nothing to show for it. I am however building equity and drilling things into walls like a madman just because I can.

You can't really answer any of these questions with certainty. Renting is flexible but unstable, it leaves you with nothing to show for it. Buying is expensive, inflexible in terms of moving regularly but leaves you with a house to show for it. Typically if you want to stay somewhere long term buying will be preferable, not least for the psychological element of feeling secure."

I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,[deleted],1,"There are a few questions in your post. The answers actually depend on your personal situation.

You mentioned some rents with bills included. I presume this is in a house share, I don't think landlords would pay bills for a single occupancy. When you are on your own, whether you rent or buy, you have to pay the bills (council tax, water, electricity, gas, broadband...). In term of insurance, the mortgage provider requires the landlord to have a building insurance (this is to cover damages due to fire, flooding or things like that). The contents insurance (to cover stolen things for example) is not compulsory.

Now, when you rent, the rent is a pure loss for you. As others said, your rent pays the mortgage and profit of the landlord. Paying a rent is still the best when you are young, not settled or you don't have enough savings for a deposit. But, when time is right, you should buy. Mortgage providers will look at age to decide to lend you some money or not. If you are a first time buyer at 50 with not much savings, it will be hard to get a mortgage. Especially in London, I guess that if you have just enough money for a deposit, you are looking at a 25/30 years mortgage. And of course,  you would prefer to own completely your accommodation when you are retired.

To buy, you will need a deposit. This is minimum 10% of the price of the accommodation. It could be as low as 5% with the help to buy scheme. But that is still a lot of money. There is also the stamp duty, the calculation is a bit complicated, but there is a calculator on the government website [here](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/calculate-stamp-duty-land-tax/#/intro). In the UK, the most common type of mortgage is a repayment mortgage with a fixed interest for an initial period. The initial period is usually 2, 3 or 5 years. To make it clear, during the initial period, the mortgage repayment will not change as the interest rate is fixed. When the initial period has elapsed, it is usually best to change mortgage provider and get a new initial period. The interest rate of the mortgage depends somehow on the Bank of England rate. You may have seen that the Bank of England has recently increased, so there is a risk that the interest rate of the mortgage increases too when you find a new mortgage."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,[deleted],1,"I have no regrets about leaving my rental. I have a much bigger pot of equity even if the market were to crash, I still have more than had I been renting.

This however is due to level of income, if you earn a higher amount as other posters have said, investing over a long period may bring higher profit/revenue.

Personally I dislike the inequality of renting, don’t put nails in the wall, no pets, leaky roof not fixed, rubbish white goods - whereas if I buy I can turn my wall into a piece of Swiss Cheese if I wish lol!

Generally it is better to own, but it is very personal. I know some  wealthy people who rent and invest but again, they have low rent and high income."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,psrandom,1,"Buying and selling house is expensive, in terms of money but also time n efforts. Others have already commented on how young people don't have any money for upfront payment n have to rent instead

But you also have to think about other costs. Renting gives you more freedom. Young people don't have set work life n personal life. You don't know what you will be doing next year or who you will be with. With renting, moving within city or across the world is easy. Most leases have some break in clause and if not, you can always move at the end of the lease.

If you own the house, it's much more difficult. So, only if you are certain about your career n personal life for next 5 years, owning a place might be the better option"

You rent, because you only have enough money for the month-on-month commitment of renting but no money for upfront deposit, stamp duty, and the like. At the end of 2 years you'll be paying the same amount (or a few quid more) and you will be about £20k down but nothing to call your own. Pros? It's cheaper, if something breaks you let your landlord know. Cons? You can get evicted/rent increases/and whatever you do to the house it is still not your own.

If you are smart and/or rich, you'd buy a house. It costs a lot more upfront with deposit, stamp duty, etc. And it \*CAN\* cost a lot more through the year BUT at the end of 2 years, though you are paying the same amount, you will be about £20k invested into what you can call your own home."

I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,[deleted],6,"Few other items: buy to let mortgages tend to be more expensive, property management fees in many cases, turnover in rent is higher so more frictions (estate agent fees and so on).

Also worth thinking about the two components of profit. Landlords of course charge more than their costs in most cases, generating positive cash flow. But they also accrue the benefits of property price appreciation (this can result in loss sometimes!)."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Chaosblast,-16,"That's just the standard fallacy everyone uses and this is going to confuse the guy.

Don't compare rent to mortgage monthly payments. It's only one bit of the equation."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,DomesticatedVagabond,14,"The private rented sector is a recognised issue in this country. Being a good tenant only reaps rewards if you have a good landlord, which seems to be the case for *you* but not the majority of the country. [Renting prices are increasing nationwide](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/14/private-rents-in-uk-reach-record-highs-with-20-rises-in-manchester).

[A House of Commons report](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7328/) into the PRS found nearly a quarter of homes were not to a good standard, concerns around no-fault evictions, and a worrying power imbalance between tenants and landlords.

The same report, citing research by Citizens Advice, found 60% of private tenants experienced disrepair their landlord was obligated to fix, with 1 in 5 saying it was not repaired in a reasonable amount of time, and 1 in 10 saying it was never repaired.  


You're also liable to lose hundreds from your deposit if your landlord or letting agent just tries it on. Our previous letting agent claimed £245 to 'clean', £96 to remove 'items', and £24 citing all lightbulbs were not working. Yes - we clearly lived in darkness! After dispute our deposit was returned *in full*. If we hadn't taken pictures of move-in, move-out, and logged every disrepair, we'd have lost hundreds.

Model tenant or not, you can get taken advantage of."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,shenme_,3,"Sounds like you got lucky and found a good situation. 

Unfortunately with renting, the landlord can decide at any time to kick you out for any reason (including ones that have nothing to do with whether you're a good tenant or not), which would then mean you'll need to find a new place and start paying that extra £500 a month right away."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Big_Target_1405,1,"Basically, your mileage may vary. I've been a no fuss perfect tenant my entire adult life and everywhere I've lived landlords have put up rent 5%/yr without fail. It's only when I've pushed back have I seen a reduced increase."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,SmallCatBigMeow,2,"Yeah I think it’s quite normal in first couple of years of ownership - you’ll want to modernise and some things previous owners put up with you won’t, other things just have come to end of a lifespan. I wanted more modern floors and sleek doors that weren’t made of plastic, previous owners didn’t mind artex ceilings but I did, roof was 70 years old when I bought the place and needed replacing and while I got to keep existing white goods, I’ve had to replace all of them in the last year. It was helpful to have the old ones for the first year but yeah, it all adds up. In the next 3-4 years I’ll need a new boiler. I won’t cost me a fortune forever but even just painting adds up when you got a lot to do. Almost all my friends who’ve bought have gone through this and those who haven’t have bought new-builds or properties i could’ve never afforded."

I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Chaosblast,2,"I was just providing one more experience. You only hear complaints, but that's not all there is. I wasn't trying to say there are no problems. 

Again, there can be problems with renting. There can be as many if not more problems with buying."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Chaosblast,-7,"Whatever. I think it's a total fallacy to justify a purchase ""because the mortgage payment is cheaper than the rent"". 

The deposit and what you do with it while you rent, plays a major role on the comparison. If people keep ignoring that the herd behaviour will continue. 

There are many scenarios where you would be getting more return of your money by renting over 25y than buying with a mortgage. You just need to do all (!) the numbers."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,MrsPeanut18,2,"Not to mention what happens when you retire, on a fixed (ish) income, if you don’t either own or have a secure rental."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Shreddasaurus,2,"The deposit and moving fees etc could be invested, and you could work out the gains of that over 30 years, sure. But it still seems unlikely that could outperform ending up with a house plus the lower monthly cost of mortgage (which won't increase with inflation) vs rent (which will)."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Chaosblast,-1,"Yeah, if you've wasted all the return on investment and extra costs a rental has given you over 40 working years, let's blame it on the rental. lol

Yeah, if you're someone who's not into money management or investing, definitely go for buying. At least that way you're doing something with your money. 

But if you do, a simple index fund with your saved deposit (and extra purchase costs) might get you financially better off. 

But yeah, for money illiterate people, buying a house is the easy and still decent option. That's why it's generally recommended by the herd."
I know this may seem like a dumb question but why is buying cheaper than renting?,Battle_Lower,0,"The irony of that last paragraph.

You've been exceptionally lucky to get a good landlord. You said it yourself, you're paying 500 less than similar places. Would your investment figures stack up if you were paying market rent?

No."

ELI5… house insurance when selling and buying,pumaofshadow,1,"Previously I kept the selling house insurance until completion and set up a new policy on exchange for the purchase. Didn't ever have an issue during that time so I never had to try to claim on either during the time between exchange and completion.

Tbh the cost of £50 or whatever wasn't big enough to make me question doing so (and my insurances were never more than £200 for the year anyway)."

"FTB, household bills for 1 person",MerryGifmas,3,"Most of it looks sensible. £250 a month for energy is high. £120 a month for food + essentials seems low but if that's what you're spending now then fair enough. Add contents insurance to your buildings insurance, won't be much extra.

FTB - is this financially do able?,p3zzl3,7,"I was always told to steer well clear on shared ownership mainly because when you decide to move, if you don't own it all, it's a pain to sell and can depreciate. GL though :)"
FTB - is this financially do able?,orlandoaustin,1,"Ok I will answer in two parts.

Is this reasonable? 

No. In my opinion I think it's a bad idea. Firstly, it's shared ownership. That should make alarm bells start ringing. Expect the costs to only go up. 

What are your thought on our situation?

Buy something more reasonable for a cheaper price which is not shared ownership. Your wages are not going to get you far so your locations should not be an issue."
FTB - is this financially do able?,OCreates,3,"My research led me to the same - mostly from looking on this sub and the PF sub. However, in regards to selling, we’ve seen SO houses going on the market and off again within a week around here. All of the SO houses on this new build have sold except this one that we’re looking at and we’re hoping to staircase to 100%. I don’t know if that changes things or not though in peoples opinions?"
FTB - is this financially do able?,Eddie666ak,4,"Do a search on this sub for shared ownership, plenty of people have said they have sold their SO properties. It's more difficult than selling a fully mortgaged property, but they still sell. From what I understand, it's more an issue when you own a large percentage. Because people who can afford it would rather buy outright than an 80% share, and it's too much money for most people who are looking at shared ownership because they'll be looking at a 25%-40% share."
FTB - is this financially do able?,p3zzl3,1,"I guess I was fortunate that as I work from home, I could move to a preferential area.  You do what ya need to do obviously and if they are selling  cause of simple supply and demand, then you should be fine  :)"
FTB - is this financially do able?,OCreates,2,"Which is exactly why we’re going in at 40% share, so it gives us options in the future. Honestly most of my research has been Reddit, looking on here and the personal finance subs but so far in life I’ve always found them to be very useful. 

That said, it’s another reason why we’re looking at this house in particular, the resale value on it will be much better than other houses we’ve looked at imo."
FTB - is this financially do able?,Eddie666ak,2,"I'm no expert, but I think people tend to come to reddit to complain about bad situations, like most things people don't tend to come onto sites to say what a great experience they've had. There's nothing inherently wrong with SO, I think it's a great scheme if you go into it fully aware of the pros and cons.

Personally I wouldn't view SO as a way to make money on resale, rather it's a secure and cheaper than private renting way to live (and one where you're also paying off your own mortgage, rather than a landlords mortgage)."
FTB - is this financially do able?,OCreates,2,"I agree, and it’s something that I often have to remind myself - I’m always seeing the same things repeated on here (SO bad being one of them) and then repeat the same things irl. It’s definitely something I’ve been more conscious of - I’ve never actually heard anyone irl complain about their SO house and I know a few people that have them. In fact when I asked, they said how great they were as it’s allowed them onto the market where they wouldn’t have been able to before. 

No, and we’re not - ideally we’d love to staircase to 100% and live there long term, I just brought up the potential resale of it as another plus I guess."
FTB - is this financially do able?,Eddie666ak,2,"Ultimately I think if you know what you're going into and it suits you then go for it and not worry what people on Reddit say. People on here are always saying SO is a scam and they get massively upvoted. It's so very clearly not a scam, it's just not suited for everyone. It's for people who can't afford a whole mortgage but also don't want to be stuck private renting paying someone else's mortgage."

Having to go back and undo all your admin because things got delayed is a real kick in the teeth, and the utility companies will screw up cancelling the move and cause your seller issues.

Similarly, check the cancellation terms on your movers, and consider how much you're willing to risk losing due to delayed completion Vs how much you want to secure the moving date. They might offer a cancellation fee waiver for a little extra to offset the risk (but still cheaper than a 30-50% cancellation fee!)

Booking tradespeople is fine, since they're easier to cancel/postpone.

Insurance for new home prior to moving in,treeseacar,1,New policy for new purchase. Cancel excising policy when you move out. You will have a contents overlap but insurance is very cheap and trying to get just buildings on the new place then switch your existing contents policy is likely to be more expensive.

Finally Completing Next Week... But Still Nervous!,WFly76,1,"Hi. We recently exchanged and completed 4 weeks apart. I, too, was fraught with 'what ifs'. I worried the house would get flooded by a burst pipe, that Nationwide would decide not to offer a mortgage after all, that we'd be homeless with a dog lol.

It all went through as expected, the house was dry and the dog loves it here! 

You've got the relevant insurance in place. Please try to enjoy the feeling of knowing you'll be in your new home soon. 

Wishing you all the best on moving day and lots of happy memories in your new gaff!"
Finally Completing Next Week... But Still Nervous!,DeadlyTeaParty,1,"Cool! I'll be completing on 16th May after 5 months!! 🙌

Can't wait to get in! I'm a first-time buyer. 

What makes you think, the sale will fall though? Just make a few more calls between now and then for updates and hopefully those updates will remain good news. ☘️"

We did this recently for a house we bought in Dec 2023. The sellers put up a bit of resistance and wanted to offer an indemnity, but we said we would not accept anything other than a regulisation certificate as we knew this would otherwise cause us problems when we come to sell.

Luckily our council were very quick, and the certificate was issued within 2 weeks. Not sure on the cost as the seller was liable for this."

As other have suggested you can apply for retrospective approval (Regularisation Certificate), this will include all the regs applicable at the time the work commenced.  Bear in mind you may need to open up/remedy some work.  
I've dealt with hundreds of these as a BCO and, providing the work was compliant and needed little or no additional work, have dealt with them and issued a cert in days not weeks.

Consent to Alterations in ex-LA flat,erm_what_,2,"They sell indemnity insurance during leasehold sales for a reason...

If you tell the council then you have to pay and also can't get indemnity insurance. If they find out after then you have to pay more. If they never find out then I guess it doesn't hurt anyone.

The guide says you even have to tell them to put up shelves. I'd guess there are thousands of contraband shelves across the borough and no one cares.

I wouldn't personally expect to tell the council for every little change, but I absolutely would for anything external or vaguely structural because that affects the whole block.

They have a rule that prevents adding new locks, but you probably wouldn't want to as the current doors are bombproof in most council blocks and you wouldn't want to accidentally fuck the mechanisms up.

For anything that changes walls it's also worth taking advantage of their structural engineers as they'll probably require it, but also no one is going to understand the building better than they will.

The kind of things that need legal work would be when you buy an extra bit of the building, merge two flats, or something big which would need legals anyway.

Also, given the 60 day+ turnaround, some things just have to be done without permission.

At least that's my view.

Consent to Alterations in ex-LA flat,Date_Spiritual,1,"Thanks, that's really useful! I'm pretty new to all this, but no one's mentioned indemnity insurance so far. Is that something the solicitors are likely to recommend if they think its needed, or is it something buyers have to push for?

If your flooring has got fucked up then talk to the neighbour and maybe involve insurance but if it’s a small drip as you describe there’s nothing for insurance to do.

Advice for renting with pets?,jarofsticks,2,"Keep looking, keep trying. Be polite and charming and honest. Ask letting agents to ask if the landlord would make an exception, offer more deposit money, offer to show them where you live now and how clean etc it is. 

Do you have a good relationship with your current LL? Could you ask them about what makes a difference with pets etc from their perspective. 

Also look for private landlords who manage properties without letting agents, ask friends of friends, look on gumtree etc. Obviously be careful with this one but fwiw I found my current LL on gumtree and he allowed me the property with two cats, two dogs and bad credit (I had an IVA which is similar to bankruptcy), he had loads of other people interested, but my messages were clear and polite, I answered his calls straight away and viewed it etc no issues. Been here 8 years. He's a posh Englishman who does everything by the book, must be nice to be able to afford lawyers and accountants etc 😂

Also also, get registered on council housing system if you're not already. 

Good luck!"

Claiming insurance on water damage to downstairs' neighbours,[deleted],4,"The landlord is not at fault here so cannot be expected to claim on their policy. If the LL pays out, or the insurance does, you can expect whichever of them foots the bill to come after you for the money.

Wall dents.,52north,8,"You do not need to buy buildings insurance as a tenant. The landlord will have the building insured. 

In any case, your idea of taking out an insurance policy after the damage has been caused would be insurance fraud. 

Your landlord can only deduct the amount needed to repair the damage. I assume your deposit is protected and if you think the deduction is too high you can challenge it.

How big are the dents? Is there an actual hole on the wall? You could post here or on r/diyuk - the chances are it's a simple fix."
Wall dents.,Girlwithnousername,4,"You are panicking. Stop it. You have literally just moved in and no money can be taken from you until you leave.

Dents from furniture being moved usually come under wear and tear, which means you are not financially responsible, assuming there's not an inch deep gouge that goes through plasterboard. Are the walls elsewhere in immaculate condition? I think it is unlikely.

You do not need buildings insurance, that is the landlords responsibility. You only need contents insurance to cover the cost of your belongings in case you are burgled or there is a fire.

If you want to fix the problem yourself because you are worried, google 'how to fix a dent in a wall with Polyfilla.' You need Polyfilla, £3 a box (buy it in powder form, the tubes are rubbish), sandpaper (£1 for a batch of various types from Wilko) and possibly some paint to cover it up. Most places are painted Magnolia in colour or just plain white and you can buy a small sample pot from Wilko for £2 that will easily cover it and a paintbrush for £1.

Landlords expect properties rented by students to be damaged, so whilst I admire your desire to make things good, please bear in mind that the damage from the bed is small fry for a landlord and really should not worry you.

That said, if you can fix it before you leave, do. It will make getting your deposit back just a bit easier (even if it just removes the mental burden from you!).

And no, he is absolutely not allowed to take your whole deposit for this damage, even if you don't fix it yourself.

Finally, if the thought of losing the deposit this early on in your tenancy is of such concern, please make sure you take lots of photos and maybe even videos of the condition of the property before you move out, so you can make sure you are certain to get ALL your deposit back. I would include taking photos of the inside of a clean oven, kitchen cupboards with doors open to show the insides are clean, carpets, windows etc. These are the sort of things that scummy landlords try to deduct, so protect yourself."
Wall dents.,Shectai,2,"Like people have said, if the dents are noticeable then have a go at fixing them. You could probably take the filler out again if it goes badly.

What I was actually commenting for is that if the headboard is still an issue and might cause more dents then you could get something to go on the back of it; I bought a self adhesive felt strip from eBay for mine."
Wall dents.,MonkeyPuzzles,2,"It's not actually difficult to plaster over a small hole, plenty guides on youtube etc. Hiding it fully can be tricky with a colour match for the paint though - is it a large section of wall? Is it usually hidden in shadow?"
Wall dents.,intellectualnt,1,"Yeah that you for telling me about the insurance fraud part. Like I said Im pretty new to all of this and have never had any kind of insurance on anything. As for how big the dents are, they pretty small kind of like indents and not proper punchers through the actual dry wall. I want to post pictures on how the wall actually looks so people have a better Idea but I don’t use reddit a lot so I have no idea on how to do that. If I figure out a way I will post pictures of it."
Wall dents.,intellectualnt,1,Thank you for your advice. The dents aren’t that deep. There mostly just little indents on the drywall because of the headboard.
Wall dents.,AugustCharisma,2,I use those plastic furniture bumpers behind my bed. I think I got a pack for a few pounds at Homebase (no B&Q in our town). Those are both DIY stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot in the US (aka Pinterest).
Wall dents.,intellectualnt,1,Hmm I never thought about it. Like I said Im new to all this.
Wall dents.,intellectualnt,1,"I don’t know how to exactly describe it but the wall is on left side of the room. The dents in particular aren’t exactly too big, if the lights were off or at dims the dents are barley noticeable. As for how the wall looks, its just pure white and since its drywall its not exactly smooth. The main part of fixing it myself is the areas that are “fixed” looking different from the areas that aren’t."
Wall dents.,52north,1,You can upload the photos to imgur and link them here?
Wall dents.,Girlwithnousername,2,That’s absolutely fine and you shouldn’t be expected to fix them. LLs will expect dents from furniture being moved. It definitely falls under wear and tear.
Wall dents.,intellectualnt,2,"I’ll google those, seems like a good solution. Thanks for recommending it!."
Wall dents.,Shectai,1,"If you're filling a hole, leave the filler slightly raised and then sand it down. If you smooth it level it might sink in as it dries."
Wall dents.,intellectualnt,1,"Is the general wear and tear part usually a part of all tenancy agreements within Uk? Or does it vary from agent to agent?. Like I mentioned Im new to the UK so I don’t exactly a lot, hence why I’m asking very basic questions."
Wall dents.,Girlwithnousername,1,"It's absolutely standard across all tenancy agreements in the UK and it doesn't matter what one particular agent says, or what a contract says. 'Fair wear and tear' is the law.

Other examples might be scuffs on walls from moving furniture or the deterioration of silicon sealant along kitchen worksurfaces."

Protections?,[deleted],4,"They sell financial services, so they tell you to buy all of the financial services. Buildings and content insurance absolutely.

Verse… what’s your risk appetite

To edit: I have contents and building insurance but not the rest (although I have some wage and life insurance through work) I wouldn’t pay for it but then I don’t have kids and my partner earns a decent amount."
Protections?,itallstartedwithapub,1,"I would first check what your employer already provides - many have life insurance or equivalent. 

Beyond that, consider the likelihood that you'll need to ever use the policies like critical illness cover, and examine what exactly they'll provide under which specific circumstances."
Protections?,skehan,1,House contents insurance absolutely. I would also get a policy that pays off the mortgage in the event of your death as it’s really not that much a month (at least mine isn’t) as I wouldn’t want to leave my partner with that sort of debt. These are personal decisions though and everyone is going to be in different circumstances and or have a different opinion.
Protections?,OutdoorApplause,1,"You'll need buildings insurance as a condition of your mortgage. Contents insurance is also a good idea.

We don't have any other cover, but we both get decent sick leave from work, plus enough death in service benefit to cover half the mortgage.

If we had any children we'd probably look at life insurance, but for now that's enough for us."

Cat scratched landlords furniture - rip,WG47,7,"> EDIT - The main reason we're worried is because through losing my job I fell into a 'zero deposit' tenancy, which is now why I'm terrified they'll want to fuck me over.

With no deposit to deduct from, their only course of action is to take you to court to recoup the costs of the damage. Generally though, zero deposit tenancies cost more monthly than a normal tenancy; you still pay the equivalent of a deposit, it's just spread over the length of the tenancy and you don't get it back at the end of the tenancy.

Part of buying insurance is declaring that you aren't going to make a claim for damage that's already occurred, and you can't make a claim for the first month or two, so you'd be committing insurance fraud if you did so.

Leather chairs in a house with pets seems a daft idea, mind you.

Bear in mind that even if you slashed the chair up with a stanley knife, you'd only owe the value of it at the end of your tenancy. It might've cost £800 new, but things depreciate. How much would that chair be worth today if there hadn't been this damage? At worst, that's how much you'd owe the landlord."
Cat scratched landlords furniture - rip,badger6789,6,"Why are you paying them £390 for a professional clean? 

If you have not already done so retract that offer and don't pay it. Your only obligation is to return the property to the state it was in when you moved in.

Worried about cost of living and renting for the first time - check my budget?,Pyewacket69,0,"£150 a month for food for a couple is completely doable, but it is on the economical side and you'll need to know how to shop, cook and stretch meals to make it work.

That's £9600 a year... A lot of people survive with £50 a month left over and no savings.

If you are planning on buying a house in future I would be getting as much of that spending entry into savings as possible."

Renting questions,AussieHxC,2,"Re: tenants liability insurance I'd recommend urban jungle. It's about a fiver a month, add an extra fiver if you want contents too."
Renting questions,Tnpenguin717,1,"The fees they are trying to charge you are 100% illegal after the  [Tenant Fees Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tenant-fees-act) came into force. Get their request for fees in writing on an email or something then report them to the Property Ombudsman or Trading Standards, agents that are still trying this on need to be wiped out. 

I am pretty sure they cannot force you to have Tenants Liability insurance either. It used to be quite common for LA's to insist you have this but its not enforceable any longer. 

That said it isn't a bad idea to have this insurance."
Renting questions,[deleted],1,"Fees have only been banned for tenancies covered by the Housing Act, which is most but not all of them. If the tenancy doesn’t fit the criteria for an assured shorthold tenancy then all fees can still be charged.

As for the landlord insurance; it’s increasingly common to require tenants to have insurance covering accidental damage to the landlord’s fixtures and fittings. This is to protect landlords."
Renting questions,agforce,1,"Fees have been banned and this agent is in the wrong. 

This has been well documented in both the national press and industry press. 

[Info here](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/private_renting/letting_agent_fees_for_tenants) 

Tell the agent that you won’t be paying any fees to them for renting a property and make an application for the house if you like it and want to love there.

If they are members of industry body ARLA then make a complaint to them.

Re the insurance - it is common to sign a tenancy agreement confirming that it is your responsibility to insure your belongings - I’m not sure an agent needs to see proof though. Is the house furnished with a lot of thenlandlords items?

EDIT: I assumed you are located in England"

This is not entirely correct. *Most* fees for *most* tenancies have been banned. However, it is not a blanket ban and there are numerous exceptions."
Renting questions,AussieHxC,-1,Exceptions like ?
Renting questions,[deleted],2,"The main ones are; the property is a second home (or temporary accommodation), the tenancy is in the name of a company rather than an individual, the annual rent exceeds £100k or the property was originally constructed as one dwelling and the landlord lived in another part of the building."

Renting questions,AussieHxC,-1,"Yeah I thought as much, just sounded like a very strange way of wording it all. 

So basically the tenants fees ban in ast tenancies only applys to set tenancies. Funny that. 

Unless op is a lodger, and I'm going with unlikely here due to an agent being involved, do you imagine they are renting somewhere as a business, second or temporary home or somewhere with an extremely high cost? 

No, ergo the fees remain banned."
Renting questions,[deleted],2,"They don't have to be a lodger.  The tenancy will not be covered by the Housing Act if the building was originally constructed as one dwelling, has subsequently been divided into separate dwellings and the landlord lives in another part of the building.  This means that if you have, for example, a house with a basement flat where the landlord lives in the main part of the house (Or vice versa), the tenancy will not be covered by the Housing Act even though they won't share facilities with the landlord.  This sort of scenario is far more common than you think, especially in big cities where there are countless large Victorian/Edwardian houses that have been turned into flats over the years.

Anyway, that's getting away from the point I was trying to make which was adressing the misconception that the Tenant Fees Act has banned  **ALL** fees.  As I said it has banned *most* fees for *most* tenancies but not all fees for all tenancies.  In this case it's more than likely that these are prohibited fees but it's not a given."

FTB - Bills rough idea,TheAviatorPenguin,4,"Any old estimates are going to have been thrown out a bit by recent price increases, but have a look here for an idea:

https://www.britishgas.co.uk/energy/guides/average-bill.html

For a 1 bed you're looking at about 150 a month for energy.

https://www.southernwater.co.uk/account/average-water-use-and-cost

£300 a year for water.

Broadband can flex up and down, 10-50 a month depending on package and speed, but you choose

https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/blog/insurance/how-much-is-the-average-cost-of-home-and-contents-insurance

Sub 200 a year for home and contents.

All just estimates, but should be in the ballpark. Energy is probably the one you need to look at the closest given everything recently, others should be OK."

Its a mixture of wooden and carpet flooring. The carpet is indeed probably a write off, its all soggy and its already quite dirty anyway.

If it were to be reported to the council as a hazard, how much would they actually be able to do and actually do, considering the flat itself is considered privately owned. If they needed to repair the building then they'd need access which obviously could be tricky"

And she pay appropriate tax on any profit (but presumably there won't be any profit in its just an accounting exercise) and apply all safety requirements as specified by your council. But renting a BTL to family requires a regulated BTL mortgage as most standard BTL terms prohibit renting to family.

If there is no mortgage on the property she can do whatever arrangements she likes. Not that any of this is your problem it's your mums. But these things can upset mortgage lenders when they think someone is renting their property without permission.

You would best placed to call the insurance company and ask. But insuring your contents as a tenant is probably the right option as you don't own the property. You don't need to pay rent to be classed as a tenant. The owner will be responsible for buildings insurance. 

You may wish to get a formal AST tenancy set up even if rent is just £1. This gives you protections if you fall out with your mum and she wants to kick you out."
What Kind of Occupancy is this Classed as for Home Insurance?,S_ELF7,1,We will consider this - thank you for the advice .
What Kind of Occupancy is this Classed as for Home Insurance?,S_ELF7,1,Are we still able to get contents insurance under that status?
What Kind of Occupancy is this Classed as for Home Insurance?,S_ELF7,1,"Thanks for the detailed response. I forgot to add that it is a cash sale (no mortgage involved). 

As it is a flat, the service charge & ground rent covers buildings insurance.

Not too concerned about a falling out as she is the kind that puts her kids first so much it’s a fault (has been supporting a jobless 37 yr old bum for over 10 years when he treats her horribly).

General consensus is renters insurance then. Thank you for your help."

FTB - Finally About To Move In (Fingers Crossed) What Do We Do?,itallstartedwithapub,3,"TV License and broadband you'll need to sort out yourself. Some people apply for broadband before completion to reduce the time they're without internet. But don't do it before exchange.

The council will send you a letter after you move in to ask for council tax. Councils seem to be very efficient at collecting money.

Energy you can be proactive, find the supplier and set up an account with them after you move in. Or you can wait for a bill to arrive in the post in a few weeks. All rates are essentially the same at the moment so there's no particular rush to do anything.

Water they will send you a bill, you don't get a choice of water company so again not much to do here."
FTB - Finally About To Move In (Fingers Crossed) What Do We Do?,VonBlitzk,2,"I am completing Monday. Moving in the following weekend. I checked with BT about broadband at the beginning of this week. They gave me a connection date of February 28th, 8 days after I complete and 4 days after I move in.

I would suggest dealing with a broadband contract now if possible, if Internet access is essential for you."
FTB - Finally About To Move In (Fingers Crossed) What Do We Do?,[deleted],1,"You shouldn't need to be fully moved in, just as sure as you can be that everything will go ahead on the agreed date.

Gas & electricity - I was able to just tell Octopus (suppler in my previous property and now this one) I was moving out of my previous property and in to the new one ahead of the move in date and they got readings automatically from the smart meter. The seller took some photos of the meters anyway and sent them to me - it was helpful to have them just in case. I did it far enough in advance that they took over the day I got the keys. You should have been told who the current supplier is to the property. If you want to stay with them, there's not much to do. You'll just go on to their standard variable tariff that'll be capped. If you want a different supplier, contact the one you want. But you won't get a meaningfully cheaper price anywhere.

Dunno about water, not a problem for me in Scotland.

Council Tax - Similar to g&e, I notified both councils of the move and gave them the date I was getting keys once I was happy it was a sure thing.

Broadband - Organised that ahead of time to be installed the day after we got keys. I was just moving my existing account over though."
FTB - Finally About To Move In (Fingers Crossed) What Do We Do?,DigitalStefan,1,"Everyone has made good suggestions. Mine is ""massive amounts of cleaning"", because it's likely you'll start to look a bit more closely at things and realise what the previous occupants have been turning a blind eye to for the length of time they've been there.

Check the electrics. The spur switch for our dishwasher was faulty and wouldn't switch on. I took the front off and it had melted. There was also no fuse fitted because idiots be idiots. Check you can actually get to the fuse board and if you want to get ahead of things, play around to see whether you've got an upstairs light connected to the downstairs lights circuit, because we do and I've lived in a few houses where things like this were true.

Find out where to switch the water off. You'll wish you had if anything springs a leak. *Check it actually does turn the water off, those valves will just stop working or refuse to turn after some years!*

You might be on a water meter and not see a water meter in the house. If so it's in the street under a wee metal flap thing that your water company will come and read every 6 months. That's probably also where the external water shut-off valve is.

Know exactly where your property boundaries are. Fences aren't always the actual boundary.

Check that all the windows and doors close and lock properly. Ours don't. 20 year old UPVC and a lot of the hinges have shifted. If the windows have locking handles, have you got all the keys?

When it rains, if you get water pouring over the sides or ends of any guttering, get someone to go up there and clean them. If you leave it, you'll end up with damp inside. If the guttering has gaps and isn't fitted together well, it needs sorting.

Don't panic about anything highlighted on a survey. Apply some common-sense to decide what needs fixing immediately, what can wait and what isn't in need of sorting. We had highlighted that the heating oil store didn't have an automatic remote shut-off in the event of a fire. The surveyor probably missed the fact that the oil store is much lower than the oil boiler, so no oil would flow into the house in the event of a fire anyway."

Compensation for damaged belongings due to leaks in rented property,ex0-,3,"The agents are right, this is what contents insurance is for.

Your only other option would be to due the LL.

The water bill side of things they should cover, send them an email with pre leak bills compared to post leak bills and ask them to cover the difference."
Compensation for damaged belongings due to leaks in rented property,WG47,1,"I'd speak to the plumber, tbh. Your insurer will go after his public liability insurance, and it'll hurt his pocket going forward. It's in the plumber's interest, as the person who caused the issue, to settle the matter with you directly.

I'd suggest it to the plumber first, and then if he won't sort it out, go to your insurer.

Of course, there's no point going to your insurer because you chose a policy with a £350 excess, and the damage is worth less than £350. Next time, consider paying a little more and getting a smaller excess.

As for the mould issues in the property, if the landlord isn't sorting it out, go to the council's private lets team."
Compensation for damaged belongings due to leaks in rented property,sec5min,1,"Any update on this?

Did you consider asking for compensation due to the fact that you didn't have full use of the property due to repairs etc.. This sounds more plausible to me than asking for compensation for damages and much easier to prove! Although, I have no idea if it's possible to claim such a thing... In a similar situation myself at the moment."
Compensation for damaged belongings due to leaks in rented property,Tomcat_95,-3,"Is that still the case when the damage is caused as a result of the landlords property being in a poor state? Feels harsh on us being out of pocket for the damaged belongings, and then paying a £350 excess to replace belongings that don’t add up to this value, so either way we’re out of pocket due to the poor state of the rented property."
Compensation for damaged belongings due to leaks in rented property,Tomcat_95,1,"For normal repairs our estate agents use their contractors, but for plumbing work the landlord sends his own guy round which we found out is his father in law so don’t think that would result in anything. By the looks of it there’s nothing legally requiring the landlord to compensate us so we may have to rely on a goodwill gesture (hoping this will work as we have had multiple contractors visits causing significant disruption and exposed concrete for 4 months throughout property as it dried out)"
Compensation for damaged belongings due to leaks in rented property,Tomcat_95,1,"We asked for compensation and the landlord offered £100, which isn’t even half what we owe affinity for the extra water. So we’re holding off giving an answer until affinity worked out why our bill was so high, and they’ve found another leak, this time from the water meter to the property (somewhere under the flat car park). So landlord has 90 days to work out where it is, and fix it or affinity will do it and charge him. 
Once that’s fixed, they’ll be able to work out how much water was wasted in the leaks and do a leak adjustment calculation. Contractors think the issue with damp and mould is due to rising damp and there are 2 potential causes of this which he needs to fix too, so don’t think it’ll be a simple or quick fix."
Home insurance: date of building or date of conversion?,seahorse28,3,We live in a converted building. Our insurance wanted to know when the building was built not when it was converted. Not sure if that helps?

Home insurance: date of building or date of conversion?,bacon_cake,2,I've actually found the same with my contents insurance. Rather than jack the price up by 50pc like car insurance companies seem to they actually remained quite competitive.
Tenant's Insurance - meeting requirements,mattb2k,3,"That seems very iffy to me. The landlord should have landlord insurance in place - and it would be in their best interest to because if the property becomes uninhabitable he wouldn’t be able to claim for loss of rent. As a tenant you obviously wouldn’t be able to acquire landlord insurance. This is very odd. 

Also fitting etc wise - that’s what the security deposit is there for. Very odd. 

You should only need contents to protect yourself. "

What counts as subsidence for buildings insurance?,Anaksanamune,3,"You really went to town on the surveys...

*little activity for considerable time* is the key point to take away, this indicates it's historical. Also bedding in settlement is not exactly the same as subsidence, old houses have much shallower foundations, so some settling under the massive weight of the building is not unheard of. If it has settled and then not moved again then imo it's not really subsidence.

Finally the seller has to declare on one of the forms if there has been any subsidence claims or if they have knowledge of subsidence being an issue. If they say no then I would say that puts you in the clear. If you ever click yes on one of these forms there is no going back - be careful."
What counts as subsidence for buildings insurance?,BornTooHula,2,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

Yes - I intended to only go for a level 3 RICS, but our lender specifically asked for more detailed reports to be carried out. Not entirely wasted money, as it's given me some more peace of mind.

I think I've seen the form you mentioned as part of the pack my solicitor sent through, so I can double-check that. But good to hear it would put us in the clear. 

The only form I ticked was on MoneySuperMarket, when comparing quotes, so hopefully that isn't significant enough to come back and bite me later!"

Renting / insurance question [x-post r/askUK],mashedintel,1,"I wonder what the deposit is for then???
Insurance is a rip off for the most part - I've paid tens of thousands now for legal compliance and have zero claims - buildings and cars over a fair few years.

Check money supermarket or money saving expert for low quotes. I'd be tempted to find a zero fee cancellation policy - just to get the docs required.

It's a grey area - not legally enforceable but they can choose who they let to - so you can refuse and so can they. 

As a landlord, I can't wait to see the government take steps to assist tenants.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-action-to-end-letting-agent-fees

After the above is enforced, 3rd party services such as insurance should be targeted.
Freedom of tenants movement would benefit everyone. 
"
Renting / insurance question [x-post r/askUK],minor_sunrise,1,"The agent will almost certainly be forcing this because their referencing agency provides insurance, and gives the agent a commission for every policy that is taken out. Plus, I assume the insurance agency will be much easier to deal with than the deposit schemes.

The purpose of the deposit is essentially to insure the landlord’s belongings (house, contents and moneys owed). I would be looking at paying no deposit if I’m being forced to insure everything else. 

As an agent, I wouldn’t go near one of these policies for one of my properties: if the tenant fails to renew the policy, I would be left with no way of seeking compensation for damage, unless there is a damage deposit (which would defeat the purpose of the insurance in the first place - except for the agent’s commission)

Saying that, if the agent/landlord is insisting that you take it out as a condition of renting the property, you either have the choice of paying for the insurance, or renting through a different agency. 

The landlord isn’t obliged to insure the house or the contents under tenancy law. "

Power Outages in rented HMO,password5788,2,"Yes to buying your own contents insurance. 

Yes, it shouldn’t be happening as frequently as it is, but your landlord is demonstrating that they’re trying to take care of it, albeit not resolving the issue. It’s worth bearing in mind that they too will be directly impacted. 

If they weren’t doing anything or burying their head, then it’s a fair point."
Power Outages in rented HMO,ex0-,2,"> How often does an unexpected power outage need to happen before it would be considered something I could hold the landlord responsible for in some legal way?

That would be a question for the court to decide, however, you know that there is an ongoing issue and you know the landlord is attempting to resolve that issue. Since you're aware of the issue you also need to take steps to minimise the items that are at risk - turn off your rigs at night etc.

> Is the responsibility solely on me to have contents insurance for my electricals (I will be getting this asap). Or would I be in my right to ask for compensation for any damaged equipment?

I don't think there's any likelihood of holding the landlord responsible for damaged equipment. Obviously contents insurance is for you to arrange for yourself and you'd use that if needed to recover your losses.

> Would it be reasonable to expect my landlord to pay for a UPS for my electricals to prevent damage if he is unable to fix the issue?

No. The option of moving out is available to you as is unplugging your stuff when not in use. A work laptop will have battery power and it's not going to be impacted by power loss."
Power Outages in rented HMO,Ztar86,1,Thanks for the input :) I wanted to make sure that if I pushed anything I wasnt being unreasonable. Indeed the landlord does try to fix things. I doubt it is down to negligence. Ill just make sure Im covered by insurance to avoid any awkwardness if something does break.
Power Outages in rented HMO,HyperClub,1,"Are the power outages just the property, or the local area?

Does the consumer unit (fuse box) have  an RCD? Is that getting tripped? Do they know why has happened. What do they do to fix it?   If someone is plugging in a faulty appliance, it can trip the RCD. Toasters sometimes have a habit of tripping RCD. That should only trip the kitchen sockets. May be too many people using too many high powered appliance. Too many people doing the ironing at the same time or boiling the kettle....  If it tripping, then there is a risk of electrical fire..... You have n't told us the cause.... so hard to tell. 

If the wiring is old, then it wont help. Instead of handyman, he should call a qualified electrician.... 

I suggest you get content insurance, if case of fire.... not sure if they will cover for electrical outage.

Power outages, can damage your PC. I had my power supply damaged due to a power outage.

You should speak to the landlord about the risk of these power outages to your equipment. 

Not sure if they will pay for an UPS, I am sure the landlord would rather fix the problem, then paying out tradesmen...."
Power Outages in rented HMO,Ztar86,1,"Thanks for your reply! 

I had a chat with the landlord about it the other day. He did give me an explanation for it. It has to do with the fact that the house has oldish electrics. He possibly said something about how the load is sometimes too much for the way its set up. 

Our HBO is on a road where the houses have had several different owners (mostly with some degree of building knowledge) and all the houses have super odd layouts as one person adds more rooms, attic conversions, out buildings and extensions. My landlord has had the properly for a while now and is always working on things himself and he says the electrics have been a real pain for him. To be fair this is the nicest house share I have ever lived in.  Despite all the work going on, its always clean and tidy. Most furniture is new, a lot of the wooden furniture is custom built by him and the handyman to a crazy high standard made out of solid wood. Literally the only problems are the electrics and occasionally the plumbing. 

Apparently he recently found the problem and is currently getting it sorted. He does have electricians to check all the mandatory stuff and also offers us free PAT testing for our stuff personal stuff too. I think someone was last here a few months back. And we recently had all the smoke alarms tested too. Anything that breaks is promptly fixed too which is nice.  In terms of fixing the issue itself, I think he has had people in, but I think they tinker about themselves up there a lot. Possibly to save money? Im not sure. But he lives here too....so anything we suffer he suffers too. I might breach the subject about electricians and see what he says. I can't believe he would dodge something so important. He is pretty straight laced and proper. But who knows. 

If I'm honest I think this is probably a result of him having too many other ""passion projects"" around the house and loosing track. As a result, we have a lovely garden space and everyone has a private section of the garden to themselves. He has modded up our rooms for us (he built us a custom bunk bed and installed a big skylight for no extra rent) but has maybe neglected some of the more boring jobs for a little too long? 

He also said he would buy a UPS for us cause he felt bad. I just have to find one thats not crazy expensive and he said he would get it. I made a point of telling him not to pay for the graphics card before he refused to make it less awkward. And Ill get my content insurance! 

But yea, Ill see whats going on re electricians."

Red flags with broker? ,absolutelyoffmychest,2,"They sound disorganised, I'm not sure if you can swap brokers now the application has been submitted but it sounds frustrating. 

I can message my broker and get a response within 2 minutes. Updated at every step of the way and their communication is first class. 
We were initially with another broker who was rubbish at staying in contact. We asked her for the DIP 4 weeks ago and she's still not got back in touch with us. My partner took some persuasion to look elsewhere but we're both so glad we did now and couldn't imagine being in the dark about where we were in the process"
