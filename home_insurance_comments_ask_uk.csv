Is there any point to home insurance?,IpromithiusI,11,What are you insuring for £1k a year? I have buildings and contents for about £15 a month!
Is there any point to home insurance?,LaidBackLeopard,8,People successfully claiming on their insurance doesn't make for dramatic telly. I was in a house that was partly flooded. Insurance coughed up quickly and were generally great.
Is there any point to home insurance?,Al-Calavicci,6,"That sounds like people not insuring honestly.

We had a house fire, the insurance couldn’t have been better, the loss adjuster even told us to claim for more than we were because we undervaluing our claim.

These shows are all about people who didn’t have the correct cover or didn’t divulge all the information required."

Is there any point to home insurance?,Darkheart001,3,"Bear in mind TV Shows like this only pick the horror stories that are a tiny % of claims. My last 3 claims (over about 15 years) were all settled fairly and well by my insurer. I would say it’s totally worth the money, I would have had to pay out 1000’s without it.

Claim 1: water damage to a large driveway from a broken sewage pipe. Completely replaced the driveway and cleared up the mess, would have cost £3000.

Claim 2: slipped in the shower and cracked the bath. Bath was replaced but they cracked the tiles putting it in so they replaced those as well, but that damaged the shower so they did that too, got a whole new shower suite, would have cost around £4000.

Claim 3: attempted home invasion with guys with baseball bats and blow torches. They ruined the patio doors but I scared them away before they could get in. Doors replaced with new more secure locks £1800.

Currently paying about £350 a year for home insurance, worth every penny.

People who are happy with their insurance and treated well by them just don’t make good tv."
Is there any point to home insurance?,thelajestic,2,"You're paying far too much for your home insurance, so you should probably take a look at that firstly. 

I think it's worth it. In my last place we got flooded when a neighbour 2 floors up had a pipe burst. The water came through our upstairs neighbour then pooled under their floors and came through our ceilings in every single room of the flat. Insurance paid for us to live in a very nice serviced apartment for a month while our flat was dried out, fixed up, replastered, redecorated (in colours of our choosing, didn't even need to put them all back to magnolia which is what they'd been when it got flooded). They paid for someone to pack up all the stuff we weren't taking with us, put it in storage, and bring it back to the flat after the works were done. Also paid for a deep clean of all the dust etc after works were done. The carpet was ruined in a couple of rooms and we wanted to replace it with laminate, we got the option of paying extra to get them to fit laminate or take cash and sort it ourselves (which we did as it was cheaper).

It was extremely stressful to be flooded but the help from the insurance companies was amazing and took a boatload of stress off of us. It was also two separate companies (as it was a flat, we paid contents insurance, the buildings insurance was done by the factor for the building. Carpets were sorted by contents insurance, the rest was the building) and both were fab and really helpful."
Is there any point to home insurance?,ben_jamin_h,2,"My mom's fridge set on fire about two years ago. The fire spread to her kitchen cabinets before the fire brigade managed to put it out. The whole kitchen was damaged by the smoke and the fire, and the whole house was damaged by the smoke too.

I think the damage was something like £25-30k

Insurance put them up in an Airbnb type place for about three months while the house was investigated and cleaned, and the burnt / smoke damaged stuff was stripped out.

Mom then got some money from them to pay for a lot of the remedial work, and also more money to pay for damaged contents of the house.

I think the total amount of money paid out for the damage, the items and the accommodation was something like £40k. It took about a year or maybe 18 months for everything to be completely repaired and paid for, but it did all get done.

Sure, if you have £40k+ sat in your bank account just in case something like that happens, don't worry about insurance..."
Is there any point to home insurance?,tmstms,1,"I have it for emergencies.

Recently the dormer needed a new roof. The insurance helpline said I could claim it as storm damage.

BUT....

I had set an excess of £2000.  The builder's estimate was £2100.

Yes it's worth having insurance. I had storm damage to my previous property  and insurance paid it all, over 9k worth of damage."
Is there any point to home insurance?,DameKumquat,1,"I have a complicated extended house that standard online insurers won't cover (too big or too difficult). Broker found house and contents for about £700 a year. Recommend you call one.

Had to claim twice, once when neighbour's tree landed in our garden demolishing our shed - still cheaper for both us and them than getting the tree and old shed demolished. Second time when a fence and garden wall came down. That was a bit tricky as they wanted 3 quotes for repairs, and getting any quotes is a nightmare. 

Eventually the builder who did quote 1 got his subsidiary to do another quote and the insurer couldn't find anyone to do a third, so they went with it.

Being underinsured is a big problem, though. When I got our house we were told the rebuild cost would be 1/3 the house value, but cost of builders has changed so much I don't know if that's still true."

Home insurance called our builder to haggle on claim - is this standard practice?,CoffeeIgnoramus,7,"The aim of the insurance is to put you back to what you were at before the issue. They're also a business. Why pay what you don't need to?

They're trying to prove that they can pay less. But to do that, they need to builder to quote less. The question is what did they actually tell him?"
Home insurance called our builder to haggle on claim - is this standard practice?,Ok_Cow_3431,2,"I worked as a home insurance claims handler several years ago so have some insight on this.   
 
I'm going to assume the builder provided an itemised quote. An insurance company wouldn't have any way of knowing what the works should cost aside from the quotes you get for builders (their own building suppliers if they have them will always be considerably more expensive) but it's possible they've spotted things in the itemised quote that they don't consider to be part of the claim - I would have done the same thing  
  
However I admit it's odd that they're speaking to the builder directly about it and not you."
Home insurance called our builder to haggle on claim - is this standard practice?,rm212,3,"Aware of all that obviously, but I’ve not heard of them bypassing the customer entirely on a cash settlement and directly calling the contractor on the phone without notice to pressure them down. Can’t find much about that on the internet either from searching. 

They didn’t tell us much, they just said that they told him they’re willing to pay £275 less and that he needs to come down to that to settle the claim. 

As I said, the contractor was over £1000 less than the the other two quotes submitted and I felt they were already giving a very fair price for the amount of work to be done. I’m just concerned that their aggressive and direct approach may result in that offer being withdrawn and relationship soured. 

Ultimately, the insurance likely doesn’t care too much about this, because it’s another delay for us to find another quote where they can avoid paying for a bit longer if they muck up the offer."
Home insurance called our builder to haggle on claim - is this standard practice?,rm212,1,"Thanks for this. Yes, they got an itemised quote from the builder after asking us for it. They gave us a number they were willing to pay, which was lower than the quote they got from the builder. They said they needed to see the itemised quote to come up.

After getting that, they haven’t raised any issues with any items in the itemised quote - it’s all the same stuff that the loss assessor documented as needing to be replaced and they haven’t told us, or the builder who we spoke to after the insurance called him, that they have any issues with any items. They just want him to do the job for £275 cheaper than what he quoted. 

So I was not wrong in finding it weird that they called him directly - thanks for clarifying. I find it baffling that they’d go around us and speak to him directly without even telling us until after the fact!"

This bit is them haggling. They have to get the work done to the standard you had... or more to the point, the standard you've told them you have. ""I had a hob"" and ""I had the top end [brand] hob"" will get you very different compensation.

They're just pushing him down because they need to pay someone to do the work and obviously, this person is the cheapest already, so they're trying their luck. If they can't get a quote for less, they'll still have to pay it. Having said that, if they do find someone cheaper, I guess they can still go through them. You paid them to cover you for what you had. They now have to honour that.

Yeah, unfortunately they don't care about your relationship. They just want to spend as little as possible. They need to pay you or the contractor the amount it costs to put you back to where you were. No more, no less.

Can they go to your builder... if it saves them money, why wouldn't they? They are the customer in this situation."

Is home insurance worth it?,AdAffectionate8738,7,"Home insurance is for more than burglary

And you want to prevent burglary and then be protected if it does happen."
Is home insurance worth it?,cantab314,3,"CCTV will deter some criminals though not all. Being insured won't. Burglaries are traumatic for the victim even if insurance does cover the financial losses.

CCTV will only help catch the crooks and get your stuff back if the police care, and all too often they don't.

The alternative to paying for contents insurance is planning to replace things out of your own pocket. Which is better depends on your own financial situation and value of what you own I think. Be aware that repeat burglaries are really common - if a criminal burgles you once, they'll often wait what they think is long enough for you to replace the stuff then come back again. This obviously has a far more significant financial impact if you're not insured."
Is home insurance worth it?,keeponkeepingup,7,"Sensible to have it, even with all the other security features. Not for just burglarys either - what if you have a flood (either natural or leave the bath running), or a fire?

It doesn't cost much I think mine is about £14 a month and that's for both buildings and contents insurance. If you rent,  you don't need buildings cover and contents only would be like a fiver a month."
Is home insurance worth it?,buried_treasure,3,"Obviously premiums depend on where you live and other factors, but for me at least combined buidings & contents cover is under £150 p.a.

It means that if need be we could replace anything that got nicked (add up all laptops, consoles, mobile phones and other bits and pieces and it's well into the thousands). If the worst really came to the worst and the house burnt down, they'd buy us new everythings.

Well worth it for the price of a Costa coffee each week, if you ask me."

Is home insurance worth it?,[deleted],4,"I spend around £10 a month and that's in London. Worth it for the reassurance. I've had a couple of friends get through major disasters (one a huge fire, one a flood, neither was their fault or predictable based on where they lived) and having insurance meant they were a couple of hundred out of pocket rather than needing to find money for ovens, carpets, decorating, beds, etc.

When we got burgled once we even made money on it despite being very honest about the costs of what was lost. It also covers my belongings on any trip inside the UK, or just being outside the house; my glasses cost an absolute fortune, so it's worth it for that alone."

Is home insurance worth it?,gdrlee,3,">it's only a small amount to loose

If you have enough cash available to replace all your valuables then, yes, this is an argument against the need for insurance. If you don't have that sort of money then insurance lets you pay a relatively small amount each year to guard against a sudden big expenditure."

Is home insurance worth it?,folklovermore_,5,"Home insurance is generally split into two sub-categories - buildings insurance (which covers the structural stuff and I believe things like plumbing and electrics as well) and contents insurance (which covers your possessions, furniture etc).

Contents insurance covers burglaries and theft (though check the policy for what level of cover you have), but if you own your house I'd get a combined policy that also includes building insurance - it isn't much more expensive and if nothing else it's peace of mind if something happens to the structure of the property.

Rebuild/contents value for home insurance?,professor_dobedo,2,"I had this problem and the rebuild cost calculator doesn’t work for all properties.

Rebuild/contents value for home insurance?,ShipSam,2,"Does it not tell you on your current insurance documents?

Mine has the rebuild cost of my home stated on my insurance schedule."
Rebuild/contents value for home insurance?,HopAlongInHongKong,2,"Usually the insurance company, not the broker will specify an amount or walk through the construction, materials, size, age, etc.,  with you to establish a value, and as long as you agree with their amount (which is the basis for the premium), then they'll rebuild it even if it costs more.

Unlimited would be handy but it's impossible to understand how the premium costs would be set if house a) is worth £2 million and b) is worth £350 thousand. There has to be some basis for computing the premiums or b subsidizes a.

Contents is typically a percentage of the rebuild cost and additional living expense is also a percentage, to allow enough money to live away for a year or however long it takes.

I'd not trust a broker who asked me to determine this amount. Call the insurer, regardless of the fact you now have a middleman involved. If they think you underrepresented the value so your premium was lower and you have a loss, you might be denied all the coverage you need."

Also, people should always review their policy needs before renewing, whether that's with their current insurer or a different one, because their insurance needs will change. 

My contents insurance cover for ""stuff"" has gone from about £5k covered to about £40k over the years - partly because the standard level of cover has increased, but also partly because the replace-with-new cost for things has also increased significantly. 

My old pushbike, for example, was £200 new but an equivalent today would cost over £1k; if I hadn't upped my insurance cover as time went by I wouldn't have sufficient contents cover and that alone would void the policy. Computers, tablets, tellies, expensive kids toys... It all mounts up and often to quite a bit more than you might think!"

If you withdraw a claim does your home insurance premium still go up?,SleepFlower80,1,Probably. They note all claims on your insurance file and it stays there whether they pay out on it or you withdraw it.

Home insurance claims experience?,Username_LOLZ,2,"I've never made a claim but when doing comparisons on home insurance make sure each one actually has all the cover you want. I find home insurance worse than car insurance when it comes to what is and isn't covered. Comparison site only compare so much, you have to go into each one to see the bits that aren't compared.

Last time I changed I ended up with Hastings. They were about twice as much as the cheapest on the comparison but when actually looking at the detail they covered more things to a higher value."
Home insurance claims experience?,Aedaxeon,2,"Admiral are good in my experience, they're also usually one of the cheaper providers and the first contents insurance provider I've used who didn't massively hike the price at the end of the first year. Heck I made a claim for a burglary and the premium went down the next year. Maybe they assumed everything of value had already been nicked.

Most companies don't care if you get a cheaper quote elsewhere, the best they usually do is offer to massively increase your excess to reduce the price. Which is pointless because they're then offering a worse product for the same price as you can get by moving."

Home insurance claims experience?,Martyn_X_86,1,"I've just gone through making a claim with MoreaThan following a leaking hot water pipe bringing causing significant damage to a ceiling. Dealing with the Insurance company themselves has been fairly simple, its the people that the sub contract some of their services to which have been what can only describe as s**t. 

The process of getting an emergency plumber out was pretty straightforward, but the first plumber was only able to identify the problem, not fix it. They arranged a specialist which left us without hot water for 6 days in total. Cue complaints on my part and a 'goodwill' gesture of £50 for their slow response.

A damage surveyor was sent out within 24 hours of the issue being fixed, and was helpful, but the amount quoted to fix the damage was laughably small. To contest it in any way, you need to get a builder to quote you for the exact works they suggest, itemised by labour and materials cost. All within 21 days, or they automatically force you to accept the derisory amount they suggest.

Have you ever tried to ever get builders to do a quote in a short amount of time? Let alone to that level of detail? It's near impossible. 

In the case of the ceiling damage, the builders I know all said they would refuse to quote for the work the surveyor suggested because it's the wrong way to fix the issue and make it good. 

Which means every part of the claim process is designed to discourage you from claiming for a legitimate reason.

Legalised extortion

Rant over!"
Home insurance claims experience?,OK_LK,1,"Most insurance companies offer a cheap introductory price. They then rely on inertia of the policyholder when it comes to renewal time. They hope the policyholder is too lazy to do anything and allows the policy to auto renew. They recoup the 1st year's discount in the 2nd year's premium.

Then they just keep jacking it up. There is no reward for loyalty. Always show around each year.

Tesco Bank Insurance is underwritten by other insurance companies. They are the companies that are actually insuring you and you will make a claim from, if need be. So, investigate the underwriting company on Trustpilot.

In general, Trustpilot is a good place to get reviews. Tesco Bank doesn't score very highly."
Home insurance claims experience?,eastkent,1,"Tesco contents insurance paid over a grand for a new carpet after an unfortunate incident involving the consumption of dodgy alcohol by my missus. No complaints here.  

I always change every year anyway though - this year's renewal with whoever covered us last year was £120, but Confused said (weirdly) the best price was £38, and many others weren't far behind that. £38 for a year's contents cover with accidental damage cover?! Yes please."

Home insurance claims experience?,[deleted],2,"That's frustrating! Personally I'd look at a cheaper option, but just make sure to properly read the terms, whats included etc as you don't want to be caught out"
Home insurance claims experience?,eastkent,1,"That's my experience too; they don't care any more. There's probably only a small handful of actual insurers though so it's likely they'll still get money from you, albeit a bit less than they were hoping for."
Home insurance claims experience?,melbourne_hacker,1,"Market is too competitive these days and the market is currently in the hands of the writers, so prices will increase (a few insurers lost a case recently due to COVID so they’ll look to cover that cost in premiums). Agg sites will always be cheaper because there’s less profit in it (which is why you pay more on renewal). 


It sucks but switching companies for a year and trying again later is seen more acceptable because price matching isn’t really a thing (although risky if it were)."

Home insurance with subsidence?,_MildlyMisanthropic,9,"the insurer that held the cover when subsidence was identified should be extending cover, you need to go back to them  
  
And yes, if the property has recently been bought from someone, that means their insurer should be covering the property  
  
Subsidence is a really weird one in insurance terms; insurance only covers one-off, sudden unforseen events and subsidence is the only exception to that rule. Since subsidence occurs gradually over a period of time special exceptions are made, such as the previous insurers continuing cover.   
  
Source : used to be a home insurance claims handler.

"Home insurance claim for stolen bike, help?",sea-turtle13,6,"Feels like something you should pursue, as contents insurance covers everyone in the household, and it's bizarre that they can pick and choose whose belongings they decide to cover"
"Home insurance claim for stolen bike, help?",MercuryJellyfish,2,"If you named the item, it should be covered. 

Their argument would be that you do not have an insurable interest in the personal belongings of your partner. To be legally allowed to insure something, it has to be something that harms you if it is lost; you cannot, for instance, insure your neighbour’s house, because if he’s burgled, you aren’t harmed by that.

In naming this bike on your policy you’re effectively claiming that you are harmed if your girlfriend’s personal property is lost, and they’re denying that part of the claim on the basis that you’re not. You can argue this on that basis; you’d have to show that there is a loss to you, personally. 

I’m afraid I don’t work that end of insurance, so I don’t know what might work or what might not. I would suggest, for instance, that if you claimed that you were in fact the main user of the bike, and it was necessary for your daily commute to work, you might have an insurable interest, as loss of the bike affects you directly. I know that insurable interest requires that you be harmed or suffer a loss, rather than you having to own the property. 

When dealing with an insurance company, you’re always dealing with people doing things on the cheap. Insurance is relatively cheap, and insurers cut costs by minimising the number of qualified people involved in handling your claim. Sometimes, you will find that arguing the point is enough to get them to change their position, particularly if you make it clear that you are prepared to involve the Financial Ombudsman Service if you are unhappy with their decision; it’s cheaper to buy you a new bike than pay staff to fight the case. But equally, sometimes they’ll fight you every inch of the way. In which case, it wouldn’t be wise to claim something that you couldn’t prove."

I used to work in handling home insurance claims, I'd be particularly interested around the policy definitions because this will say whose contents are insured in the property - there's a chance since they live together that the girlfriend can be classed as 'family' but again, need to see the policy booklet to bottom that out.

Boring Home Insurance Question,whatmichaelsays,1,"> Why can't my current insurer match my renewal quote to the same price as a new quote? It seems such a faff cancelling and then signing up as a new customer

Some do, some don't. At the end of the day, it's a commercial decision. 

Insurance pricing in recent years generally means that profit margin takes a big hit in year one, and insurers make this back in years two, three and beyond. This is the direct result of the growth of price comparison websites - getting to the top of that listing with the lowest price is the best way to get the business, but it affects margin.

As you say, changing insurance is seen by many as a hassle, and they factor this into their pricing for the subsequent years once they have captured a captive customer. The insurance companies have largely calculated how many customers renew in subsequent years, how many will leave and how many will ask for discounts. "
Boring Home Insurance Question,grmacp,2,"Aye but there is no difference between the level of cover, the amount of compulsory/ voluntary excess and the extras  like accidental damage.

Incorrect.

>Besides the utter foolishness of gambling with the weather that could destroy the house at any time and she'd lose everything without insurance to cover the cost, what if a brick blows off the roof and hits a pedestrian? 

We functioned well before the days of insuring everything.

If a brick from her house hits a pedestrian, then pay up. Shit happens and this is why she is supposed to have an emergency fund.

>She would be liable for millions in compensation. But she insists that it isn't a legal requirement and that nothing bad will come of not having it. 

This isn't America where people can claim millions in compensation. In England & Wales, an injured pedestrian is only able to claim the costs incurred because of injury, and then some as sorry gesture. They might be able to claim for lawyer costs. It's likely that any claims caused by incidents similar to what you mentioned will only cost 4 figure number.

The average home insurance cost is £150 per year. This would take between 10-50 years for her to recoup the cost. Sounds bad? Not really, you have to consider the fact that the chances of this happening is close to nil.

Do you know why home insurance exist? It's because it would cost insurers paying out the claims less than what they would earn from insuring customers. With this assumption, the statistics state that she is more likely to save money by not insuring in a long run.

Nonsense! It's not like car insurance where there is an obvious risk of damage to other peoples property. If your house falls down, no one else is effected, it's your property - your problem.

>Besides the utter foolishness of gambling with the weather that could destroy the house at any time and she'd lose everything without insurance to cover the cost,

If the weather is that bad where she lives, good luck finding an insurer that'll cover her!

>what if a brick blows off the roof and hits a pedestrian? She would be liable for millions in compensation.

As long as your mother isn't letting the building go to complete and utter disrepair then I can't see anyone being able to make a claim for a freak accident like that. 

Roof tiles fall off houses and damage cars more often than you'd think, 90% of the time it is the car owner who is liable for the cost of any damage to their car.  To claim from the home owner, the car owner has to prove that they suffered loss due to negligence. If your roof is solid it's not your fault, an 'act of god' if you will. 

>I don't want to report her to the council but if she leaves me no alternative then I have to.

No, I agree it is totally stupid not to have at least buildings insurance (which is not usually that much). Ask her this - what will she do if her house burnt down? It floods? 

People sometimes say insurance is pointless as insurers charge more than they expect to pay out and so you should self insure through savings. First, this is not always true (some very competitive insurance markets do not charge more than they expect to pay out - they rely on making money on investments whilst they have the money) and second it does not work with home insurance due to time. You can reasonably easily self insurer against your TV breaking as it does not take long to save up how much it costs, however, you cannot usually do that with a home - it would take decades to save up, all the time being at risk.

If she doesn't want to buy it there's nothing you can do short of get it yourself.

That said, it's the sort of thing where if something terrible happened, she could end up massively out of pocket, or even homeless. A fire, for example, could leave her with literally nothing apart from what money she's got in the bank.

It's a brave argument captain!

At this point, no insurance policy anywhere makes any sense at all. For car insurance firms to make a profit, the premiums must on average cost more than the payouts. So why should any of us pay it? Surely we'd all be better off paying compensation from our own pockets?

That's not why it exists, that's the business model of insurers.

It exists because it is a product people want and are prepared to pay for.  People want it because the consequences of being wiped out by something like a house fire are potentially devastating.

If OP is covered, as suggested by the fact that they've made a claim anyway, means the insurance company is probably on the hook for paying out regardless. What OP can do is let the insurance company know the cause, so they can throw their entire bureaucratic and legal weight behind targeting an Amazon product, rather than OP trying to tackle the beast themselves and getting absolutely nowhere"

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,happy-clappy-,628,"Sky once offered me sky sports for 20p a month. I was sure they had it wrong so I got the lady on the call to repeat herself again and again so there could be no doubt. 
Low and behold, when the bill came through it was not 20p a month. I talked to accounts and their manager, who then put me through to complaints and their manager. I stayed calm and was v friendly but took the stance of “I know 20p a month is a ridiculous amount which is why I got her to say it loads. Check the recording. Why would I make something this daft up??”
Eventually I got to super complaints, who went off and listened to the original calls. 
So the outcome was I got my sky sports for 20p a month and they went off to review their staff training."
Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,LadyIvy_xo,99,"Only once, to the housing association I'm with. My front door locking mechanism broke. The door kept catching and not opening properly, couldn't lock the front door. Was having to push the sofa in front of the door and use the back door when ever I needed to leave the house as the front door was unusable. Which obviously isn't the best and the neighbours used to chuck mattresses, rubbish, bikes etc in the alley way which made it so much harder to get out (I had a 10month old in a pushchair at the time). Rang up for a repair and someone came round, said it needed a new part and he'd put a dead bolt on for now until the part arrived in about a week. That's fair enough. Week later, no word on the matter. Ring back up and finally get the guy back around. Part doesn't fit. Need a different one. Month later, still not heard anything, ring back, new appointment made. This went on for about 8 months in total before they told me they was nothing they could do anymore and they was closing my repair and saying it was completed. I kinda lost my shit abit to the repair team. Asked for the most senior member and managed to get through to the head of repairs team. He came out two days later, I explained the issues and showed him the alley way, he took one look at the door and alley way and said that it was bullshit they left me like that. Within a week, I had someone round asking me what colour door/accessories I'd like, three weeks after that and I had a brand new front door fitted and £100 compensation. The head of repairs also sent the neighbours a letter about the state of the alley way, how it was a fire risk to block the alley and that he'd be back to check it was all cleaned out or they'd do it and fine the neighbours and/or their landlord. Their landlord was pissed but oh well. I had complained to him about the alley way before and he just wasn't interested. Alley way has been kept clean since then."

If you're being completely unreasonable and have unreasonable expectations then that is a totally different matter. Asking to have an issue resolved respectfully and politely though is not 'being a Karen'."

Had multiple occasions of the pharmacy filling my bin with their rubbish - and I knew it was theirs bc it was full of prescriptions and empty pill boxes. First couple of times I just took it out again as it was in a bin bag, a few times I left it in there bc I could spare the space.

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,CynicalRecidivist,23,"I ended up in such a screaming, hysterical  fit in the local bank that if it were filmed would make me look like a psychotic Karen because I tried to do a transaction that  they told me they couldn't because of some red tape hadn't been sorted out. Everyone was staring and all the customers stopped their transactions to look. It looked a simple over-reaction to a denied transaction. 

The reality is: Both my parents had died and I had spent hundreds of hours sending in forms, visiting the bank, filling out all the paperwork, them losing the paperwork, them assuring me everything was sorted, trying to get access to the accounts (to pay for the funerals), them telling me all the relevant forms hadn't been submitted, me returning the same forms again, ringing the main branch, the bereavement phone lines, personally visiting the bank sometimes twice in one day, waiting the specified few weeks, showing them the death certificates again and again, sending off more and more forms, visiting the banks, ringing the main branch etc. 

I had visited the branch over 20 times, and phoned the main branch over 30 times. No matter how many times I had filled the forms in and visited and them assuring me it would be all sorted out. It never was...for months. 

Finally, again after being assured it was all sorted I once again visited and tried to get access to the accounts and they said ""oh, you just need to do.."" and I just lost it. I literally screamed at them (full on screaming) and crying, and hysterics. ""What do you people want from me?? I've spoken to everyone here!! I rung and showed you everything??!!! Why can this not be done??? WHY????"" I had snot bubbled, and tears and looked insane. I totally broke down. 

There was this silence and then I saw some bank manager furiously whispering to another, and they took me into a private room and had me ring the main branch (again) and suddenly I had access to the money. And they said reproachfully afterwards ""see, all you needed to do was phone the main branch"" as if I hadn't phoned the main branch weekly for the past few months. 

I am convinced that if I had of left the bank that day and not broken down I would not have gained access that day. I behaved appallingly, but I was totally broken and it had been going on months and months with many visits and calls to the bank and main branch. But I am a bit ashamed of that day (but also glad they managed to sort it)."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,Crossleeveplayer,63,"Yeah me last week. I thought I would never call for the manager but I felt mugged off so wanted to speak to someone 

I moved to a new area and popped into Morrisons after a night shift to get some baby milk. I was unfamiliar with the store so was browsing, taking my time. I noticed when I was walking around the store, there was a guy walking behind every aisle I was in. I found the baby milk, picked it up and noticed the guy was a plain store detective behind who had his hand on his earpiece  and said “yeah he’s leaving now” 

He then followed me and watched me pay for the baby milk, and waited for me to leave the store. I was just going to walk out and then thought fuck that. I turned back and asked if he was referring to me when he said “yeah he’s leaving now” I also asked why he ONLY followed me despite other people being on the shop floor He just blanked me and walked off. 

I felt like I was being discriminated and targeted, cause I have no other reason to think why he and the other guard at the front were watching and following me since I walked in the store. I hate to be that guy, but I’m a person of colour, moved into a very middle class village area where everyone is white, I feel like he targeted me because of this 

I asked the guard at the front to speak to a manager. He was sound to my face and called the manager over. I explained to her that the other guard (plain clothes) followed me around the store all the way up until I paid and asked if this how a paying customer should be treated. She apologised on his behalf but didn’t really say much else then I just left 

I don’t know but at the time I just felt shitty. Never been followed before by a guard in a store, never stole anything either. The fact that a man can stand behind me and blatantly talk about me as if I’m about to steal just pissed me off"

When I got st pancras and wanted to exit the gateway I told the staff what happened and they refused to open the gate for me as they thought I jumped the barrier or something.

This person wouldn’t budge and they ended up getting the manager who I request and who was even more stubborn.

So I’m like - I’m vegetarian and sides don’t usually come on the meal the come separate as a side I’m not paying again so waitress said I wouldn’t be getting coleslaw and that I shouldn’t have ordered vegan food as I’m not vegan.

We ordered food from a local restaurant using one of the apps and when it arrived they'd labelled a box correctly but had put the wrong thing in it - something we didn't like otherwise I would've just said to keep it. The app said we had to ring the restaurant to get a refund so I called them up and explained the issue and the person on the other end of the phone said ""let me just talk to my manager"". I hear them call out to the manager and explain the situation and the manager replied ""oh no, the customer is lying, don't refund it"". Something about being called a liar just made me see red. The employee got back on the phone and started to explain but I cut them off and said ""don't worry, I heard what was said."" I then put the phone down, put everything back into the bag, then walked to the restaurant (only about 10 minutes away). It was a place we ate in semi-regularly so I knew who the manager was. When I got there I walked up to him, explained that I heard him call me a liar on the phone, handed him the bag, and made him take everything out and check each box. He sheepishly admitted he was wrong and offered the refund upon opening the mislabelled box.

Once at a very busy BBQ smokehouse rib type place with a girl. Packed to the roof, everywhere full. But managed to get a seat thanks to a waiter run off his feet sorting us out.

Ordered ribs but they didn't seem hot. Nice, but I wanted to check they were cooked. Waiter checked and explained they're slow-cooked for 72 hours or something and yes, they're meant to be like that. He also noticed my girlfriend, who is Chinese, was struggling a little with the ribs and asked if we'd like any cutlery. I asked, in my typical dry humour ""you got any chopsticks mate?"" Never seen such a mix of emotions on one face - was I joking? Being serious? We don't have chopsticks, what do I say? Fortunately we both laughed and he got it.

On the way out I saw a bloke who looked like the manager, asked him if he was, he said ""yes?"" in that ""here we go, complaint time"" way. I pointed out the waiter in our section and he rose up, ready to give this lad a bollocking. I explained I'd worked in busy food pubs for several years, eaten out in many many more, and the lad was the best waiter I'd ever seen. Run off his feet, sorted us a table, checked back on our food but wasn't annoying, checked if the ribs were cooked for us, and even handled a rather offensive joke I'd made.

The food was pretty good, but that whole fiasco made me feel uneasy the entire time and I don't think I'd go there again. 

I used to work in retail, at a relatively fancy menswear shop, so I had quite a few people asking to speak to the manager. Sometimes it was Karen behaviour where someone would bring in a 3 year old shirt with pit stains and ask for a refund because one of the elbows had ripped. In those cases, it was just because they didn't want to take no for an answer. We did have some silly policies however, and our signage was confusing on sales, so there were a few situations where guys asked to speak to a manager and I could see their point."

Work changed telephone providers from BT to another. The transfer went through and new provider started billing us. But BT was also still billing us and taking the direct debits after the transfer date. New provider had given notice to BT they were taking over the line and all that. After the first direct debit called BT, spoke with a helpful guy who said yes I can see your transfer date here, but just need a higher up to put that date in their billing system. OK simple mistake human error, he would escalate it. Month 2 direct debit comes out, I end up contacting bt again, and cancelling the direct debit with the bank for good measure by that point work had overpaid £800. Month 3 threatening letter for £18 being passed to the debt department as they hadn't been able to collect the direct debit. Someone had completed the transfer but left a few add ons still running for which we were still being billed and no mention of the £800 overpaid after the transfer date. Phoned up again someone said it would get sorted. Then a few weeks later the dept department calls to collect the unpaid debt of £18. At that point I lost my cool a bit. We don't owe BT £18, you owe us £800 for not completing the transfer properly and billing work wrongly after we left. At that point I'd put enough effort into it. Found the CEO at the time. Emailed him a list of dates and times of when I'd been in contact and what was said and that we were still being billed months after leaving. Next day at 9am his PA phoned to apologise. The transfer hadn't been completed properly, our leaving date was in their system records but that information hadn't been put on their billing system. They calculated almost £900 overpaid before I'd stopped the direct debits and a cheque was in the post the next day.


When igloo went bust I was transferred SOLR scheme to eon next ok fine. Within the first month I'd been in touch and agreed to be moved from economy 7 to flat rate ecomony 7. Was sent prices and confirmed and accepted those. Customer services acknowledged and said thanks for confirming we can't input those prices until your transfer has been fully completed but they will be effective from the date I'd agreed. Fair enough. 3 months later still being billed dual rates, going round the houses, sorry we can't give you those rates they are no longer on the system. I understand the variable tarriff changes but you couldn't put me on the agreed tariff until the transfer completed but confirmed by email my bills would be adjusted to reflect the prices I'd agreed. Round  and round till I got through to a supervisor who adjusted previous bills to the rates I'd agreed at the time. All in all £60 difference over 3 months. Being on a dual rate tarriff sucks if you are a high time day user and low time night user (eg sleeping) companies do offer flat rate tariffs for ecomony 7 just more often than not you end up confusing the customer service agents whom don't come across it often and don't know what to do when you ask to be put on a flat rate E7 tarriff.


Vodafone whom I will never use again another billing error. When the s9 was new went into carphone warehouse signed a contract at £35 per month. When the bill arrived £100 - that's a bit odd! Checked the bill online being billed at £75 a month. In the documents in my Vodafone login was a copy of the contract I'd signed at £35 a month uploaded by Carphone warehouse. Phoned customer services- its a billing error a discount hadnt been applied. 2 weeks later no resolve and the money will be going out the bank soon, couldn't afford the £100, revoked the direct debit (id given them prior notice of my intention to do this if they hadnt fixed it) with my bank just in case. Over the next 3 months I logged 18 hours in call time, countless emails on the issue, everytime I sent an email they never responded in writing and insisted on phoning, installed a call recorder on my phone so I'd be able to save these calls I did tell Vodafone staff I was recording calls. Same thing over and over, yes we can see your contract at £35 a month, the billing team need to apply a discount and its been escalated to the billing team. Each month being billed £75. I was cut off for non payment of bills 3 times, despite sending cheques which they cashed for the agreed £35 each month (oddly enough couldn't make card payments or bank transfers to my account) Phoned up spoke to an agent who everytime yes we can see there is a billing dispute you shouldn't have been cut off and reconnected again. After 3 months pretty much said if you cant honor the contract then let me out of the contract as you have breeched the terms by billing me over the agreed price, I was told time and time again it was £800 to buy out the rest of my contract. At the time I was struggling with my disabilty, I kept location sharing on with my partner over what's app so he could make sure I got home OK on my way home from work. Being cut off meant I had no way to contact anyone if I got in trouble or needed help. Over 18 hours of call time, numerous emails and finally got through to a customer service rep in Glasgow. He took a while to read through all the notes, check the contract and realised that after 3 months I'm still being billed wrongly, changed the contract end date, so effectively I was out of contact and could leave penalty free. Thank god for a bit of common sense.


It's always billing errors and it's always me putting in more work than should be necessary to get things fixed. Mistakes happen, and the customer service reps often can't help except to log a case with the billing department, but after 3 months I've kind of ran out of patience."
Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,Dydey,3,"I moved house not too long ago and as it’s a new build, I had no broadband connection and no date on when it would be installed. I spoke to EE, who I was in a contract with and was trying to move it to my new address. They said they didn’t have a 4G option, but I could take out a contract for a 4G router and either cancel in the 14 day period, or cancel after 3 months at no extra charge. So I did that and ended up getting connected 15 days later, so nevermind I’ll cancel at the 3 month mark. I cancelled, nothing was said and I just happened to check my account and found I’d been hit with a £500+ bill to cover the whole duration of the contract. Called them, explained and got told I was lying. So I told them I wanted to escalate to a complaint and I would be taking this down the legal route so I wanted to submit a DSAR request because I’d need their recording of the original conversation. At this point the person in their complaints department begrudgingly agreed to listen to said recording, but warned me that “when” they found out that I’d made it up, they would still be charging me the full amount. The next day they called me back and told me they wouldn’t be charging me."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,[deleted],3,"Only one time when I was 19/20 and working a job where my boss wouldn't let me pass my probation, or even start the process of passing it. The probation period was 6 weeks, in the contract and handbook it said in those 6 weeks if you don't pass your probation your contract is terminated, but I was still working as ""trainee"" on a lower wage for 5 months.   


Whenever I asked my GM he would say ""oh, it's out of my hands"" or ""the powers that be say I can't do anything"" or ""once i get the green light from head office, I'll do it right away"". And when i asked who the head office or powers that be were, he just said he wasn't allowed to tell me.  


So I went online, found out who was head of training and head of HR, emailed them both and the next day my GM is furious. Sits me down, slams down the employee probation manual, really angrily asks me all the questions, signs it off and gives me a new contract at full pay. I think he got in trouble for it.   


It fucked me over in the end, I had been working 40-45 hours a week before, then once I got the pay increase he cut my hours to my contract minimum of 20 and i wound up leaving a few months later."

Just as important though, in this case there was nothing whatsoever wrong with asserting your rights. Asking to speak to someone's manager is a perfectly reasonable escalation of a customer service issue. In the last 10 years, the standard of customer service in the UK has plummeted and sadly escalation often is the only way to make progress. Never feel guilty for asserting your case and using all means legal open to you.

If ever you are being stonewalled, one of the most effective things you can often do is to ask for the legal address of the company and the name of the person to whom legal actions should be addressed. Even the act of asking usually triggers escalations made impossible by other means."

Another take: I work in customer service. Since I’m the one dealing with the shit day in day out, I’m absolutely the best person with the best understanding to help you, as long as you can give me some time. Because everyone forgets that they are not the only customer sometimes and some things take time, effort and brain power.

My manager can approve some things sometimes, yes. I also think it’s another issue that managers have the ‘permissions’ unlike us frontliners who help people day in day out. Don’t you think we’d like to be managers too?

If I've been given shitty service, misled on terms and conditions or received a product that is faulty, mis-sold, not as described, abjectly failed under warranty or I'm not getting the service I've paid for upfront, I'm not absorbing someone else's fuck-up / bad service at my expense

We stayed there regularly with work so after a manic 12-14 hour shift a hot dinner and a pint is needed to finally unwind, and the only option was the hotel restaurant because it’s in the middle of nowhere. 

Each time we went, service was shit. Slow to take your order, slow to ask you if you want another drink, slow to ask if you want any condiments, slow to ask if you need the bill etc. 

We also always made a point to tell them to serve each meal as it was ready rather than bringing all plates out together as there’s a lot of us and when they do that, it always meant half the food was cold and as it took much longer to prepare 8-9 plates at once, plus we always ended up waiting 45+ minutes too. For whatever reason, they couldn’t ever get that right and one day we finally snapped. 

We’d said serve them as and when, but they didn’t. 50 minutes later half the plates were served, lukewarm but whatever we were hungry. 5 minutes passed and nobody bothered to give us cutlery or condiments. Half the table sat there ready to eat but can’t. So one of us got up and barged into the kitchen and the waitress was just stood playing on her phone. Had a go at her. She argued back. Finally got some cutlery sorted. Reheated the cold plates. Received the remaining plates. Asked to speak to the manager who didn’t have a fucking clue what to do or say.

I contacted support and told them to cancel my subscription because money would be going into my account and i need every single penny for rent. 

Well what do you know, they didnt cancel it and it renewed and i wasnt able to pay rent in full because ubisoft didnt let me cancel a subscription. Messaged support and was angry, let them know the situation and asked for a refund or that i would ask for a chargeback through my bank because i had proof i contacted them before it renewed.

What happened was I was on a beer run, getting a crate for a weekend of gaming when I was about 20. I brought my step-brother along. Grabbed a crate, went to the checkout... ""Have you got ID?"", so gave her my driving license, ""does he have ID?"". ""No, he's not a part of this transaction. I have money, I have ID, here you go. And besides, he's older than I am"". Still wouldn't put through the transaction.

So, per her request, a manager comes down. I do the same back and forth, realise I'm getting nowhere, and ask the manager ""suppose I was here on my own with my 13yr old brother. Would he need ID for me to buy beer?"", and he said that no it was different... Except its not really. So it was at that point I realised I was dealing with a moron, so I said ""right, what I'm going to do is leave my beer here, I'm going to leave the store, and come back in on my own in 5 minutes, grab the same beer, and head to a different checkout"".

And surprisingly, he had no issue with me describing exactly what I was going to do to get around his daft rules.

The following week I was there with my 10hr old sister and I made a joke to the cashier checking me out, ""what not going to ID me because I'm with her?"", ""Oh I don't know... Better get the manager"". Ffs 🤦

Anytime I was on a beer run after that, we just went to separate cashiers when it was fine to check out. If I was buying alcohol for him because he was underage, why would I bring him into the store with me?!"

If I know that the employee has done all they can (or if they haven't even bothered) but I believe I'm entitled to more, such as a full refund, or even a goodwill gesture, I'll have no shame in asking for a manager, politely. It needs to have the balance of understanding that the employee is probably doing all they can to help (hopefully) and if so I'll always make that clear to the manager, a usually jts just something tied in with company policy that only a manager can authorise etc."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,JamesAdsy,0,"I guess so but I think the manager was even more of a Karen. So I had a bus ticket with photo ID and the paid part was separate comprised of monthly cards, in a plastic wallet.

Managed to lose the wallet and by the time I found it, the wallet had been tore open and only the photo ID remained. The parts you pay for are stamped with your photo ID serial number. Number has to match the number on the photo ID for bus driver to accept. 

Now I lost my pass on the same day I bought the ticket; I took my photo ID back the next day and explained to the lady what happened and what could I do to get it replaced. She didn’t seem to know and was like ‘I guess you’ll have to buy another then?’ I said that seems a bit unfair considering they’re stamped with your ID number so technically nobody else can use it. She wouldn’t budge so I pulled a Karen and said please can I speak to your manager. ‘She’s on lunch’ and points to the small room with open door and someone’s back. I think I let out an exasperated sigh and said ‘well when does she come off lunch because I’m on lunch to try sort this’

Well the manager heard me and got up from her seat and started full on shouting at me as I’m trying to explain what I’d just explained to her colleague, and when I said she was the one who who served me the day before and who I paid £80 for a monthly pass (back in 2013 when I was on 3.60 an hour apprenticeship wage). She comes out with “IF I LOSE A PAIR OF SHOES DO YOU THINK I CAN GO BACK TO THE SHOP AND ASK FOR A REFUND??” 

As she’s going off at me (I hadn’t raised my voice at all) a bus driver, presumably on his break, walks in and just says “come on, son” and that was that. 
Never went back there again. In my eyes, the manager was the Karen and totally unnecessary."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,jamaicanmescream,1,"I've coincidentally just been through something very similar to this -

We moved into our rented flat in September, and sorted out council tax via direct debit beforehand. This was confirmed promptly via an addressed letter.

Come October, a letter comes addressed to the former tenant, and so we returned it unopened with a ""not at this address"" note. The same happens in November, so we called up the office who confirm both that the former tenant registered their move-out date and it matched with our move-in date, and that our direct debit is fully active. They confirm the details of the conversation have been re-confirmed on the system and that nothing further would come for the former tenant.

Nothing further happens until the middle of this month, when a letter ""to the occupier"" comes, saying that a court date has been set for ""unpaid council tax"" for the month of September, and that non-attendance will result in debt collection. I call up again, and am suddenly being told that although they can confirm full payment ever since we took responsibility of the property, there is a debt on the part of the former tenant for their final month, and since there is no way to contact them (have they even tried outside of letters to us???) it has been recorded as a debt on the property. I asked for a supervisor as there is no way that, after multiple conversations, the property should not be on the line because there's an issue with someone else. Not to mention that it seems *very* questionable that they were claiming to have established a magistrate's court date without using either our or the former tenant's name. Within 30 seconds of outlining this to the supervisor, I'm being told that it's clearly an error on their end and not to worry, with every other word coming out of their mouth being ""sorry"".

That court date was set for next week, and if I come home soon to some kind of letter about it, I'll end up being the council's worst nightmare."
Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,Teembeau,1,"It's perfectly reasonable to ask to speak to the manager if you're not happy. The job of a manager in something like customer support is to manage the staff doing it, but sometimes, there's an issue and the manager should deal with it. Maybe the staff member has it wrong, maybe your situation doesn't fit the training.

This isn't about being a Karen. Being a Karen is about being unreasonable in your unhappiness, pushy, sneaky, sometimes even downright fraudulent. People who complain about having to pay extra because they're 2kg over on baggage on a flight, who think they can just push the airline to take it with ""I'd like to speak to the manager"". People who try and return wedding dresses they wore and then make a scene when told that the shop doesn't do that, and was quite upfront about that.

And you absolutely should not feel guilty about it. Anyone running a company wants to know when customers are and aren't happy. It's the lifeblood of being successful. If you're pissed off with something, there might be another 1000 customers out there that also aren't happy, and are thinking of leaving, but haven't told us. Sometimes, customer complaints highlight something that people in the company hadn't thought of.

I mean, we get Karen complaints too. And we shred them. Some people expect to get a Mercedes for the price of a Kia."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,ivysaurs,1,"I really want to stress that ""going full Karen"" is not asking to speak to the manager at all. If you're not getting a resolution to a concern or the service promised, then escalate it to a manager. As long as you're still communicating with respect to employees rather than screaming and swearing at them, then that's fine.

""Going full Karen"" is when you try to weaponise either the police or another 'authority'-type figure, like a store manager or security, against another person, or make yourself out to be a victim in a situation where you're in the wrong.

Examples include:

* a Pittsburgh Karen losing it when her kid isn't allowed to pet someone's working service dog, in spite of the dog clearly being a service animal.
* a Central Park Karen who LOSES IT when a birdwatcher tells her she needs to leash her dog in a leashed-dog-only part of the park, and then calls the police and claims he's harassing her.
* Covid Karen who raged that she wasn't allowed into a coffee shop without a mask on, in spite of other customers following the clearly signed rules, and then proceeded to verbally abuse the staff.
* anti-BLM Karen who gets angry at a home-owning person for putting Black Lives Matter on their wall. Karen claims that she knows who owns the house and insisted he needed to remove it, and then had her husband record the home-owner to report to the police.

These are all popular viral examples from the last 3 years of Karens."

I left a two star trip advisor review ( I was really angry - we’d all had to choose our options weeks in advance etc) and got an email from the restaurant apologising and asking me to book another meal with them so they could try to make it up as they felt they let me down and offering half off( it was a posh restaurant). As it happened I had a birthday two weeks after Christmas, so my sister and I booked a meal there. Our names must have had an asterisk or something because the treatment we got was top notch the whole way. In the end we had a nice meal, some wine and absolutely personal service the whole night. The manager swung by to apologise in person and tore our bill up. We left a big tip and left having had a fab night."

What was the result?,Aeshma-Diva,1,"I was having food at a pizza place in central London with a group only to find something hard and crunchy? In my pizza. Turns out it was a piece of glass, which had me stunned for a few minutes and shocked my friends. Most  of them didn't know what to say but I soon had a stern talk with management and effectively forced them to clean their set up, as it was clearly a piece of glass from a previous broken drinking glass they had not cleared up.

At the end of the meal I told the manager he had to compensate, he asked what I wanted and I said the whole bill had to be nullified for all 8 people.

Soon after I left I kind of wondered whether I was actually harsh enough (probably should have reported) as I realised it could have been far more dramatic if I had actually swallowed it.

I was speechless. I needed a car for work and had planned to drive it home that day for the upcoming week. Sales person told me this stuff tends to happen (WHAT?!) and they can get it fixed in a week or so. 

They wanted me to pay for the car - I said no as they had fucking crashed the car I was intending to purchase - I said if it could be fixed and proven that it wasn’t just cosmetic (which it turned out to be although it needed a new part) I would come back when it was fixed. Sales person made a face and went to argue so I told them quickly I wanted to speak to the manager. She sulked off and came back 10 minutes later with the manager. 

He was fucking useless but agreed they would ‘hold the car’ until the issue was fixed. Manager even agreed that these accidents tend to happen and it’s normal. I’ve never heard of such shit. 

Refused to take a discount and had the nerve to ask me to give them feedback on Google.

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,pineapple-midwife,1,"Kind of -- I had an issue once after booking an appointment for some work on my car to be done at home. 

Shortly after the notice came through about time slots, etc., I received a call from someone working at a local call or operations centre who was coordinating the mobile tyre replacement guy. 
Basically, we were out of the catchment area he was immediately serving and would be another 3-4-5 days (can't remember what exactly but it took into the following week). I was a student at the time so money was already short and not having a car meant I couldn't work, so I was fucked if it didn't go ahead soon. 

I was *really* trying not to kick up a fuss but I was quite insistent about being served, especially (as it turns out), they already knew the online booking system was having problems and they didn't preemptively cut off access to stop people from creating this exact scenario. To top it all off, the deposit we'd paid had already left the account and would be 3-5 working days before it would be returned to me. 

I was reaching my wits end upon hearing that and kept pushing the guy for a resolution knowing full well how quick a trye replacement is -- they just needed to find me an open slot in their slew of locations up and down the country. After a while, and my politely and firmly pressing the guy for more details (as well as him accidentally admitting the colossal fuck up they'd made and having no excuse, really), his manager ended up taking over the call and got me a last-minute booking around the corner from me. 

I sometimes still feel bad about being ""that customer"", but I really was just insistent that it wasn't fair they'd taken my money after knowing they couldn't do the work anyway and wouldn't be able to pay me back for the better part of a week so I don't think I was in the wrong by a country mile."

Answering your question, I had to speak to more than a manager at my own workplace as a customer due to local sensitivity- couldn’t even access my case file as a manager! I didn’t immediately escalate and ended up with deductions from my wages - escalating got me a refund and repayment plan set up properly."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,[deleted],1,"Background: I am a dual citizen who recently changed my name due to marriage. 

Was trying to get a new British passport in my married name, because that's what you do obviously.  My other non-UK passport is expired and didn't intend to renew it because couldn't be bothered & didn't really need it. 

However, upon trying to get my new British passport in my married name, I found the staff at HMPO fairly useless and unpleasant. They insisted that I can't get a British passport in my married name until I first get a new passport in my non-UK nationality in my married name, and then show that to HMPO as proof, and then they will issue me a British one in my married name. Despite the fact my non-UK passport is *expired*. Which imo is just stupid because if my other nationalities passport office insisted on the same (thank fuck they don't), it would essentially leave me in a catch-22 situation where both countries insist I can't change my passport name until I change it with the other country first. AFAIK, the UK passport office is the only one who insists on this.

At the time I got very frustrated given how fucking ridiculous that expectation is + the general rudeness of the woman I was dealing with, so asked to speak to someone else to confirm this was all 100% correct because I simply refused to believe HMPO was that idiotic. Regrettably they are, but whatever. 

Result: Couldn't be bothered going through such a needlessly complicated process so I just kept my British passport in my maiden name. Changing my other nationalities passport would be a real headache so I really just don't care and book flights in my maiden name

Have also gotten irate with another civil servant who insisted I hadn't filled in my maternity exemption prescription correctly because it was ""missing your date of birth"" despite me having a screenshot of the form I sent them. Which very clearly has my DOB on it, because it has a giant fucking preprinted ICE label from the hospital on it, with all of my name/DOB/NHS number etc on it. I can only assume this woman either didn't have eyes, or didn't know how to use them correctly 

Result: Eventually she realised she was wrong after I painstakingly told her exactly where my DOB was on the form (eg. ""It's under my NHS number, the bit that quite clearly says DATE OF BIRTH 14/07/1995 - not my real DOB obviously)

Idk maybe I'm a bitch 🤷"

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,Helpful_Camera3328,1,"I ate a meal with a friend at a chain restaurant on Cambridge Circus in London, during which we were entertained by the antics of a little mouse scurrying bacj and forth across the floor carrying a chip twice its own body length and then repeatedly launching itself into a hole under the far wall of banquette seats.

It eventually managed to get itself and the massive chip into what most have been its nest.  2 minutes later, it was out again.

Our food was fine and we were drinking too much to really care by that stage.  But on the way out (after we'd paid!), I asked to speak to the manager, very quietly and discretely to at least give them the opprotunoty to sort the problem out themselves. Unfortunately,  I got  the worst attitude back from the gent behind the counter who demanded loudly in front of arriving punters what the problem was and anything I had to say he could take care of, no need for management.

So I replied equally loudly and in front of the now gathered potential customers that we'd spent our meal watching mice scuttling around the floor, eating the dropped food and taking it away to their nest under the chairs, and they had a serious vermin problem in a food establishment.

Patrons turned around and left, and so did we.  It was closed within the month."

Last winter there was a health and safety issue in my local supermarket car park that no-one had spotted (ironically I used to work in H&S/risk assessment).

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,Severe-Meaning-6039,1,"I wouldn't call it my finest moment this was many many many years ago before the term Karen came into use.

I think the company was called Talktalk Broadband. So I was paying for broadband service through them for me and my mum at the house we lived in as it was just us two  at the time and gradually over a matter of a year we had various problems one sort of unrelated to talktalk. At the time people kept stealing the copper wiring for the service point the phone/broadband connections in the area..So as a result we'd go weeks without service while still paying for a bill and they refused to reduce the bill to account for months of no phone or Internet. Understandable it wasn't talktalks fault and beyond their control 

When we did have service after they wiring was replaced I think 3-4 times in a matter of six months the internet over a year became litrelly unusable, you'd start it up get no uploads or downloads of for weeks at at time manage to do maybe 5-10 minutes of anything then bam no internet again. So after I think a month straight of doing the usual customer service  palava just to.appease them have you reset PC tested router tried a brand new device. Have you got another PC, made sure there was only 2 users on the modem they'd say modems showing as working on their system. I even tried the Ethernet cables to be sure it wasn't just a signal issue.

I'm very tech savvy so at that point I think I'd spent a week straight several times a day doing their bs song and dance and being told router shows as working fine as soon as call ended. Bam stopped working so  my next call at that point  followed the routine then when said it's working I literally lost my temper as I'd pinpointed the issue to them modem itself via several programs I used through several friends who were IT technicians. Admittedly i shouted are you even accessing my router remotely or are you just fucking around to get paid for not doing a.job. I find it hugely coincidental that it suddenly works whenever I call but the minute the tech ends the call my internet stops working again within 3 minute and is unusable till I call again I've spent the last 6 months where it was a one off to now it's  every day for hours on the phone to your company doing this EXACT same.flipping routine....I'm about done my router is not working i slightly lied and said I'm a IT technician and I've pinpointed where the problem is you'd better get a supervisor on the phone now.

What do you know suddenly they *accessed my router* and I heard oh wow it's not even working showing no download or uploads can you attach a PC via Ethernet cable sent yup I can use my brand new laptop made me access menu . I heard oh it's really not working let me try this nope, wow crap I went  I've spent last 6 months calling more and more and every CSR said it was working fine! I said if that's the case cancel my damn contract because you charged me for a full 6 months of broadband service that was completely unusable and basically your CSRs or Techs lied to me every call I made I will be reporting this to the communications Ombudsman and you better waive my cancellation fees any any extra charges that I would incur for cancelling early because as you can see my router doesn't work period and hadn't for the last 6 months 

Guy apologized profusely. I said look I am sorry too I never shout or get angry but when I've spent half a year being told nothing wrong with my internet or router when I'm paying to use something that I can't use is irritating we've had to resort to a pay as you go dongle and that's adding a huge bill onto of the monthly one I'm paying with you.* It was one of those situations where it was a contract for I think 2 years. So we weren't allowed to just cancel without paying large fees* 

They admitted other techs hadn't been checking the router remotely And had just hit the  reset on their  and saying it worked, as had detailed logs of when he'd checked . Said I'd get 6 months free broadband and a brand new router which worked flawlessly the rest of the time we lived there. Think they tried to block my mum cancelling contract again when she moved and she kicked a huge stink saying I am not paying for TalkTalk broadband anymore because the area she was moving to wasn't even covered only BT or Virgin would cover that area. They allowed her to cancel when she told them that  I wasn't living at home anymore at that point 

It's the only time I have ever lost my cool but I'd had enough. Wouldn't recommend then to anyone after that experience I think my mum stuck with either BT or EE for anything internet related they burnt us both."

She sold him one (basically by coercion) so I asked for her managers contact details and also the conductors name so I could make a complaint.

Obvious diagnosis is the wifi component of the router has failed.

Called up and explained in very plain English about 10 times to someone who could only read the standard check list. Called back and spoke to someone who could speak a little bit better. 

They told me I need an engineer to reset the router. The router that I've already reset. 'No no the engineer does more than that'..

Wait 3 days for an engineer who resets the router the exact same way and after he leaves it fails again.

Call up and go through the exact same issue. 'You need an engineer'

So spoke to a manager who also had tbe technical ability of a child 'you need a second engineer to reset the router'

Told her to make sure he comes with a new router as that's the problem. Resets it.. doesn't work. Plugs new router in... woah problem solved."

I Karened out at ""and there's some random onions on it, which are not enough for a topping, which means you're not changing gloves between serving - and considering we ordered meat, that means you're not changing gloves for vegetarians - this is against food hygin... etc etc).

Another time at work when I was promised X promotion and new things, but then when the paperwork came offered only Y, and it took me bringing up old recordings of Teams meetings and ""off the record"" chats for them to go ""oh"".

If I am going to Karen, I'll do it with all the facts and I don't lie or exaggerate, but I will fire every cannon I have, no matter how pathetic the reason.

---------

OTOH I once went on a first date with a guy and we went to Frankie and Bennies.  It's a very mediocre fake ""New York"" style ... 'restaurant'.  

They got our order completely wrong in every way.

*HE* demanded to see the manager, wanted the entire thing comped and a free dessert.

Over a £17 deal voucher we'd used.

I've worked at McDonalds etc in the past.  After he did his full Karen thing about how it's ""ruined our evening"" I was like ""Are you finished?"" and turned to the server and said ""I'm really sorry about him - can you just sort out our original order and we *will* be paying for it."" and glared at him.

They scuttled off and I had a little talk with him about how they're all over worked/stressed etc and it was not on purpose - the evening has only been tainted by his outburst which is now making me think he has an anger problem.  He was about to have a go at me, and I did why I call ""**[The Ripley Stare](https://youtu.be/HFNly1GO5IQ?t=26)**"",  then he thought about it at the last second and apologised to me.

When the server returned, he apologised to them (without me asking him to apologise to them).

We actually had an ok evening and we did go out again.  And then we left a tip because whilst they did screw everything up, once they realised, they were very good - and it didn't need someone screaming at them in front of others to do it - all it would have needed was for him to say ""Sorry, you got this order wrong"" and I have no doubt we'd have received the same treatment.

We didn't last long, but he didn't do it again, at least not when with me.

I can Karen with the best of them, in *both* directions, but only when I *know* I'm in the right.

EDIT: third time - was waiting at a busy bus stop where 3 busses in a row (once every 20 minutes) had not shown up so there was now about 60-70 people in the queue.  I was third or fourth.

Bus comes along and we're starting to board, and between the bus and the pavement marches this woman who tries to get on just before me - literally pushing in the queue.

Oh, no.  No no no.  I stuck out my arm and held on to the frame of the door, and she nearly walked into it.

She stared at me, startled.  I stared at her and said ""the queue starts over there"" and nodded to the back of the line.

Now, at this stage, im like u/Elevensesaresilly, what are you doing?  What will you do if she ducks under?""  Answer: nothing.  I'd have done nothing.  But I stood there, arm out, preventing her moving.  She huffed and puffed, but went to the back.

No one clapped, no one cheered. And I was too afraid to look at anyone else.  Had I done a faux pas?  Is it me in the wrong?

I'm sure, inside, everyone was nodding, but fk me the audacity to attempt queue jumping.

  The only reason I knew she was coming behind me was I could hear the audible clucks and clicks from the others.  I don't know what came over me - maybe it was waiting 70 minutes for the bus and I was tired and angry and pissed off but something just ""hulked out"" in me and I was *NOT* going to let that bitch get on before the others.  And certainly not before *me*, who's been here in the cold.  Fuck you, whoever you were. 

She did not make it onto that service and like *twenty others* had to wait her turn.

I hope her socks always feel wet."

I'd bought a laptop from a specialised computer place. Lots of research, got a great price on it. Unfortunately it stopped charging. Took it in to the company I bought it off. 2 people on service desk, one being a bit of a bully. The bully took my laptop, ran a few checks, realised it was a power cord failure, checked whether they had one in stock (they didn't), then formatted my computer and handed me a reimbursement slip. No discussion about it, just bricked my computer. 


I was furious. I demanded to speak to his manager, refusing to listen to his excuses. Manager called to speak to me on the phone and spent 10 minutes trying to defend what happened whilst I got louder suggesting his poor training of his staff was clearly at fault. 


Manager then came in person. Explained this was policy, it was less than 30 days so giving a refund was the right thing to do. We went round in circles, me telling him that communication was poor and I could have simply bought another wire for 30 quid, him saying that not everyone would want to do that hence refund being policy. Eventually managed to get through to him somehow. 


Was offered a similar standard computer in recompense though only gave the sales manager an extra 100 in leeway (I got my laptop in a great sale). Was told there was no way I'd get anywhere close to the specs of my old laptop with my current budget. Sales manager however was not a complete tool and understood how shitty this situation has ended up and phoned the owner. Ended up getting a better laptop.

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,clce,1,"A lot of people running shops and such are not always all that sharp and just follow the basic rules or can't understand complex issues. Sometimes you need a manager to either understand the situation or be willing to make a decision in your favor because it's a reasonable request when the original employee either doesn't understand or doesn't have the authority to do so. I will always try to escalate to a manager to get what I need or want and the manager can either say yes or no. I couldn't care less what other people think.

However, I don't think I'm an unreasonable person. I know that no Karen ever does but I think my requests are usually reasonable and it's generally a matter of just getting to the right person. I'm always polite but insistent.

The thing is, whether in person or on phone, many large corporations have figured out that if they just make it difficult enough, people will give up and just pay the cost or accept the results. However, if you pick up a little fuss and make it easier to give you what you want than to fight you on it, you can often get it. Other times, you realize that they really do have firm rules or that no one's going to help you, and in that point you just give up. And unfortunately, sometimes the only way to get those results is to be very insistent to the point of being rude because if you don't, they will just take advantage of your agreeability and not give you what you want. I try not to blame the individual although they can cop an attitude sometimes. But I try to focus on the fact that it is the company. But, if the only way to get what I need is maybe being a bit angry and rude in order to get to a manager who can help me, and I'm butting heads with the person on the phone for example, I'll do it because as much as I feel bad for the person, I'm not going to give up on what I need to accomplish.

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,Mousey_Belle_1996,1,"Only time I had to say ""Can I speak to a manger"" was a few months ago on the phone to my gas/electricity provider. I had moved into my flat and noticed the money that I had been going into the old account so I phoned up just wanting to get the money moved over to my account befor my electricity or gas was about to stop as I'm on a top up and to stop the money going in that account.
 
It took 30/45 minutes to get to the first operator, fair dos I can wait but when I told them of the situation they had to pass me on to someone eles which was another few minutes. As I explained the situation again they had to pass me on as it wasn't something they could do, this happend for another 1 and a half of getting passed around until I actally ended up in the same department I started with. I sighed and said to the women on the phone ""lisen respectfully can I speak to a manger to help me, I been passed through operator to operator for the last 2 hrs. You done nothing wrong Im just really needing the help right now befor my top up runs out"" she understood and passed me over to the manger in a second (hm world record). 

She sorted it within 5 minutes of the phone call transfered the money into the meter and closed the account. Im not going to lie I came off the phone fuming now knowing it could of been done that quick."

At the time I booked the call out the call centre told me I'd be charged a call out fee if it turned out to be a problem with equipment/cabling on my property. The engineer comes out and diagnosed a problem at the local exchange and bumped the fault up to BT.
Low and behold my next bill included the call out charge. 
After what seem like an age on the phone trying to get this charge taken off, and multiple refusals to transfer me to a manager/supervisor, I blew my top and said ""cancel everything effective immediately I am cancelling all direct debits, you will not get one more penny off me, you can take me to court if you want, the equipment (router which remains the provider property) will be in a bag on the pavement outside my property by morning, goodbye!""

This is what pisses me off most about customer service and I know it's not always their fault that they don't know how their own system works.

My wife spent the better part of 6 months chasing a refund from Cathay Pacific for a cancelled flight. Every single agent she spoke had a different reason they couldn't give us a refund (blatantly wrong) or a different task that they needed us to do (and we did every one of those tasks). Eventually my wife got through to an agent that seemed to actually know how their system worked and understood the airline's own refund rules. The flight had been cancelled for so long the refund option was no longer straightforward but this guy just updated the system to say they had charged us the ticket amount and then issued a refund. Took less than 10 minutes to sort out."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,ButteredReality,4,"Exactly this.

I worked in a call centre for around 5 years, and in the early stages when my knowledge wasn't great, I sometimes got the answer wrong. On several occasions the caller asked politely to speak to a manager, who would then give them what they needed and then take me off the phone for a few minutes to explain the correct procedure. I never resented those customers at all.

However, the customers who *demanded* to speak to a manager were almost always in the wrong, and luckily managers did not have any additional authority over us (it was very ""it's either possible or it isn't, and managers don't have the authority to override what's possible""). The only additional authority managers did have was higher limits to authorise certain transactions, and even then all we needed to do was ask a manager ourselves, then complete whatever digital form and include the name of the authorising manager. No need for them to speak to the customer at all.

I remember one specific time a colleague of mine had a very difficult customer. She double-checked with our manager who confirmed she had given the correct information. When he continued to demand to speak to a manager, she very sweetly said ""OK Mr. X*, I will now take you through so you can speak to my manager and verify what I have told you."" 

Very occasionally, customers would ask to speak to a manager - to compliment the agent for excellent customer service. That was always a nice one."

Have you ever gone full Karen and asked to speak to the manager? What was the result?,wherearemyfeet,44,"> lots of organisations aren't very good at dealing with it when a customer dies.

It's something that's majorly glossed over in a lot of places in my experience. Granted it was a long time ago, but I was dealing with the financial affairs of a deceased client and called a creditor of theirs to wrap up everything, explaining they'd passed away, who I was, and what the goal was. Their response was that they wouldn't speak to us until they received a signed letter of authority from the client... My pointing out the inherent difficulty of getting a dead person to sign a letter fell on deaf ears, and they just kept repeating their request. Only when I asked them exactly how dead people sign something did they suggest something else: Power of attorney! Again, you don't get POA over a dead person, and their concerns around data protection laws for an individual straight-up stop applying as soon as they die, because laws only apply to the living unless specifically crafted to cover the deceased. 

It took going through two managers to get them to understand that we could sort the problem now because they're dead, but it just floored me that, even if it wasn't something covered specifically in training, the total lack of common sense from these people and the robot-like defaulting to a script response was just so natural. Not a single bit of critical thinking was applied until that last manager."

The thing is, you don't know why he reacted like that. It could well be that this is how his parents act and thus he thought it was normal. It could be that combined with having a bad day himself and the pressure of having a good first date.

The fact that he listened to you and apologised unprompted to both you and them is a positive sign. It shows that he can be reasonable and is willing to learn. If you were to take the relationship further, which obviously didn't happen, it's a sign of a healthy relationship when you can call out each other's BS and learn and grow from/with each other.

Sure.  Everything they did was wrong - the wrong drinks, the wrong starters, the wrong main course.  I, too, was annoyed.  But it wasn't the server's fault ... clearly there was some mixup on the paper things they write down on the swirly metal pins.  I know for sure the Chef didn't do this on purpose etc.  It's a mistake.  He was berating them though - not calling them the C word or anything, but he was getting wildly out of character (what little I knew of him) over some food being wrong.  The restaurant fixed it, they apologised - there was no need to ""demand"" any free stuff - we're already using a voucher for half price... If they'd offered, I'd have accepted but it was he who said ""And we *expect* a desert on top"".  Dude, chill.  It's not her fault, it's not yours or mine, the Chef didn't do it on purpose etc.  They're clearly busy and under-staffed - and besides, it just means we have more time to spend together :)  Also I didn't even want a dessert.

> The thing is, you don't know why he reacted like that. It could well be that this is how his parents act and thus he thought it was normal. It could be that combined with having a bad day himself and the pressure of having a good first date.

That's why I didn't press further or let it interfere too much with the evening - it's why we had a conversation about it and why, after his blood pressure dropped, he also realised he'd been a bit too rude to the staff.  He realised it himself - he just got carried away.  He Karened-Out over an innocent mistake and I Karened to him about his Karen..ning.  

End of the evening, we had fun - we met up again - he realised he'd over-stepped and we had make-up sex.  It's fine.  

> The fact that he listened to you and apologised unprompted to both you and them is a positive sign. It shows that he can be reasonable and is willing to learn. If you were to take the relationship further, which obviously didn't happen, it's a sign of a healthy relationship when you can call out each other's BS and learn and grow from/with each other.

The reason we weren't together after was because he used to take meth.  It was unrelated to how he treated others.  Or maybe related.

he wasn't a horrible man.  It's not like that - just we went from having a lovely conversation over breadsticks to an explosion of demanding free stuff, a new server (sorry should have mentioned) and saying we won't pay.  It was perhaps more the ""*we* expect"" free stuff, ""*we* won't be paying"".  

Please don't talk for me - I'll decide what I expect.  etc.  And chill, it's 35 minutes out of our life, that's all.

It worked out ok - but I think what could have been solved with a small joke, some awkward smiling and stuff... the end result was the same - we got what we ordered, eventually, and life goes on.

I'm sure if he'd been a bit nicer at the time, they would have offered more money off or a free dessert.  Probably.  But he didnt give them that chance, it was ... I can't remember the exact words etc but ""And now *this* has been fucked up too - what's wrong with you?  Why can't you get any of this right?  You're ruining *our* date and frankly I don't think we should pay for this level of 'service'.  And, I want a free desert.""

That level.

It's not needed.

""*We*"" haven't decided that that's what we're going to do, ""*we*"" aren't refusing to pay, you are.  ""*We*"" don't want a new server, you do.

etc.  It was the rudeness to an innocent mistake and the talking for me and on my behalf without discussing it that pissed me off.

Like I said, we went out again - once he'd calmed down etc, he wasn't a horrible person.  A bad day, a bad thing at work - sure.  I get like that sometimes.  And you *do* expect a minimum level of service in a restaurant (at least get the food *right*) but I felt it was unnecessary for what was at stake.

I'm never rude to call centre staff, and many interactions go just fine with a bit of patience.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, as soon as I get hit with some flabbergastingly ridiculous request (eg getting a dead person to sign something) I just calmly tell them that it's fraud or illegal and ask them to confirm what they said, and then tell them I'll report their company to the regulator or ombudsman if so. 

Calling it illegal is usually stretching the truth a bit, but in your example, telling you that you must produce documents that cannot legally exist could maaaaybe be interpreted as encouragement to break the law. 

&#x200B;

I always get hit with a spluttering u-turn, confirmation that they *don't* want me to do the thing they just said, and they usually find a sensible solution."

"Is my property classed as ""unoccupied""?",No-Consequence733,1,"Upvote for the interesting thought but doesn't seem correct. For example if the owner only needs to spend 1 night a month in a property for it to be defined as ""occupied"", then it would be very difficult to conclude (based on utility bills) that they were not there at all during the month.

Edit because now you've got me wondering about this:

Electricity - even an empty house usually uses some electricity (fridge, boiler, etc) so they will probably see a few kWh of usage during the month

Gas - same as electricity

Water - the only one that doesn't have ""passive"" usage in an empty house, unless someone has got a dripping tap or a leak somewhere

But yeah. For example if OP went to the house on a random evening or morning, made a cup of tea, had a shower, stayed for a couple of hours then went home. There is no way that anyone would be able to prove OP didn't spend the night there - unless the data is tracked hourly I guess"

As per the OP original post, the house is unoccupied. Popping in to get the post a couple time a month doesn't Count as occupied. OP would need to check with the underwriters to obtain their definition of unoccupied, but simply getting the post does not count as occupied.

Have been in this exact situation and the insurance wanted previous 12 months utility bills, i.,e, same time the year before so they could compare usage.

Then you may or may not want to contact your insurance, since they ought to cover it but they'll probably charge you more in future for having claimed in the past. So it depends how much it costs to repair. If it's simply a case of sealing and painting over the water stain, the bill for a decorator to do that (or even doing it yourself if you want) may be less than the future insurance hit.

If you DIY, or get someone to do it, make sure they paint the surface with a waterproof sealant before painting it. If you simply paint it, then residual water can stain the surface again."

Do UK insurance contractors make up their prices to fix things?,RichardTauber,3,"Yes, obviously. If it's a small job, ask them to price it without mentioning that it might be an insurance job."
Do UK insurance contractors make up their prices to fix things?,tmstms,3,"OK. In many cases it is easier to give an answer from car repair than house repair. But the short answer is that an insurance repair needs to be done to higher standards, 'by the book' so to speak, and so it costs more.

The person/ customer doing a job privately, not for insurance, may also wish to build a relationship with you as a potential customer. The person / company doing the insurance repair has the insurance company as their customer.

The repairer will have to justify and account for all stages of the process to the insurer. Whereas they can discuss that in face-to-face conversation with a private customer.

For vehicle repairs, this extends to using manufacturer-stamped parts, not replacement parts that might have been made even in the same factory, approved garage etc etc.

E.g. a few years ago my neighbour carelessly crashed into my car because they were not used to it being parked on the road (I had done so because there were workmen's vans in ouir drive). I was in a different neighbour's house at the time, not in the car. A private repair (quoted to me) would have been a new door from a breaker's (£100) sprayed the right colour (£50+ a tin of paint). In the event, Mrs tmstms wanted to go through insurance. That was quoted to me at around £1500. In the event, the car just went off and I did not see the bill, but the other party's insurer also paid for 6 weeks (!!) courtesy car."

Are you paying more because you can’t pay upfront?,[deleted],84,"Its the Boot theory of economics from Discworld.

Samuel Vimes earned thirty-eight dollars a month as a Captain of the Watch, plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots, the sort that would last years and years, cost fifty dollars. This was beyond his pocket and the most he could hope for was an affordable pair of boots costing ten dollars, which might with luck last a year or so before he would need to resort to makeshift cardboard insoles so as to prolong the moment of shelling out another ten dollars.

Therefore over a period of ten years, he might have paid out a hundred dollars on boots, twice as much as the man who could afford fifty dollars up front ten years before. And he would still have wet feet.

Are you paying more because you can’t pay upfront?,Dazz316,8,"I reached a flat that already had one of those top up meters installed. Immediately noticed how expensive it was. It was a larger house with high roofs so ran around turning off all the heating in rooms we never used, stuff like that. Summer rolls around and heating is just off 24/7. So except the gas stove, nothing else is using the gas. We go on holiday so I top up a tenner, turn off every plug minus fridge, freezer and sky. Return a week later and the tenner is gone.

Na fuck this something's wrong. I take a meter reading, phone the company and complain. Apparently there's a £3/month (maybe even week, was a long time ago) for having to use the meter. Why!? Fucking anyway, I ask where the other £7 went and they try to tell me it's what I'm using. I didn't have previous readings. 

I ask to have it out and be billed like normal. You didn't pay your bills blah blah blah. I tell them I've only been with them for a few months, church your records. It's going to cost me like 60 quid or something. Fine, just do it. Ended up being blocked by the landlord.

Ended up arguing with the tenancy agency about the weekly fine. They knocked it off my rent as it was an unforeseen expenditure that I couldn't avoid or something. Fine, small win. I go back and take daily meter readings. Leccy is hard to account for with lights, TV, fridge freezer on 24 hours a day. But gas is piss easy. 20 minutes a night cooking dinner and nothing else.

After only 3 days I go back to them with the ""rates"" I'm meant to be getting and what I'm getting and it's like 5x or something. They tried talking their way out of it which supposed me as I had proof now. Call ended with me threatening to go to ombudsman. However, low and behold my money went a fuck ton further than before.

The point in these things is that you can't afford much and that you only spend what you can afford. I could afford it fine and still got my wallet flushed. Frankly I should have taken it further as they'd wasted a bunch of my money. I was just happy it was sorted. Still pissed at the landlord though."

Part of what makes this interesting is that when I was in a student house share and had to split the bills, I worked out that the biggest part of the bill back then was actually the standard daily charge.

So I guess you need to figure out if she should be responsible for any of that standard charge. Because what she uses probably won't actually add that much to your bills. But if she lived alone then she would have to pay for all that standard charge herself. 


Food for thought."
What's the fairest way to split household bills?,agentrossi176,2,"You paying 2/3 representing the adult child would make sense to me. Personally if I moved in with the intention of being part of the family I wouldn't begrudge the actual child in the house. Your 20 year old is presumably not receiving loans for accomodation costs and youve decided to support them through higher education (which is fantastic of you, just not a choice your partner was in the household yet to make with you)

And another commenter is right, your student child is exempt from council tax, as is your 17 year old, so that should be 50/50 between the two of you."
What's the fairest way to split household bills?,New-Topic2603,2,"I'd say at a minimum the additional costs that person brings. 

It sounds like you'd lose a 25% council tax reduction, add extra energy costs & have more food costs. 

This is probably a small amount, mostly taken up by food costs. 

It would be unfair for you to pay for any of this.

At a maximum I'd say 50% of all costs for the household, this would assume they are being a member of the family with full responsibilities & would also gain equity in the house. 

If you aren't sharing equity in the short term then I'd probably argue to share the cost of interest. 

If they aren't taking the responsibility of the 2nd parent in some part then thats probably non-financial issue. 

Personally I'd go for either the 1/3 option you describe to keep things simple or I'd say 50% of all costs excluding mortgage equity gain. The mortgage makes it all difficult really."
What's the fairest way to split household bills?,Other_Exercise,2,"*If we stay together forever I'll probably sign over half of the house to her eventually, or split it 3 ways between her and my kids.*

What does that mean? Forever, meaning until death? As in, you'd sign the house over on your deathbed, or before then?

To me, you sound curiously half-in, half-out. You've partially protected yourself from her breaking up with you with your mortgage, but if you split up, they'd get some of the equity, if I'm not wrong. When you say home improvements, did they pay for the new boiler, for example?

British people have such a keen sense of fairness, I find it very strange. My mate has been with his girlfriend for about a decade and they're still just room-mates, they split some bills and otherwise keep their money to themselves.

I'd suggest:

1. going all-in, and splitting everything 50/50, no matter what
2. keeping them as you would a temp house guest  - no charge at all.

Yet ultimately, I'd suggest having a talk with them about what they want to do. I'd understand you'd likely be wary if things go south, but seems like you're better off asking them."

Where Can I Get Accidental Watch Insurance,specofdust,8,Why would you insure a £100 watch?
Where Can I Get Accidental Watch Insurance,[deleted],7,"I wouldn't buy any extra cover personally. It doesn't really make financial sense in this case because £30 is about the minimum I can imagine it costing, and that's 20-30% of the cost of the item. From my experience of watches, they don't break easily (especially if it's a quartz watch), so I wouldn't see accidental damage cover as being essential. If it's stolen, it'll almost certainly be covered on your home insurance (and that might hold true for accidental damage as well).

If you definitely want insurance though, a warranty with accidental damage protection is what you're looking for. Be sure to read up on the terms and conditions of the warranty though, and read reviews from people who have made claims.

You could try /r/watches if you want some tips on buying watches or some more specific advice regarding accidental damage protection."
Where Can I Get Accidental Watch Insurance,[deleted],6,Make sure your own home contents insurance doesn't cover it already.

Where Can I Get Accidental Watch Insurance,[deleted],1,"I doubt you can. The insurer would want to see the watch to make sure it was ok first, which would either mean having an office with plenty of staff or worse, having people paid to drive to your home and inspect the thing. Even the cheaper option is probably going to work out at more than £30 a watch when you factor in paying for a public facing office, staff, admin etc.

If it's a chain store selling them they can just make a deal with the manufacturer, but if the company isn't responsible for the watch before you get it it costs a whole lot more for them to know it's not already broken"

You'll never stop them completely. A lot of the scam ones originate outside the UK to there little that can be done to them legally.

Even with the TPS you may have unwittingly agreed to be contacted.

Am I able to get the council to do something to fix this?,PiNkY-PuNk,5,"The specific aspects of the property that the free holder (in this case, the council) are responsible for should be outlined in your lease agreement. But almost certainly they’ll be responsible for the outside of the property (walls, roof, windows etc) and well as any communal areas (hallways, front door to the buildings). Lease agreements often state that you should not attempt to make these repairs yourselves or have them repaired by an independent service person. So I wouldn’t attempt to claim on your buildings insurance (which by the way, you don’t really need as you should be covered by the councils insurance). 

As others have pointed out, you’ll need to register a repair with the council and they’ll normally ask for photographic evidence, so try taking this when the leak is happening. Most councils are ridiculously slow are repairing things and Covid has made this 100 times worse, but they all have complaints procedures and in my experience these do tend to get things moving. Additional letters to your local MP etc can also help if you aren’t getting anywhere. 

Best of luck!"

If you say you don't the insurer may decline to quote, or charge you more.

If you say you do have such locks and then make a claim and it emerges that you don't then you claim may be denied or reduced.

Bad experience with an insurance company and don't know where I stand?,[deleted],8,"This doesn't seem much to do with the insurance company, this seems everything to do with your financial adviser.  Either they are totally off the rails or you are really not paying attention.

Go back to them, ask them what they bought.

I work in insurance.  Policy documents are incredibly important.  Not getting them is like ordering a Big Mac meal and then only being given the fries.  *Someone* has your documents.

Once your financial adviser tells you what they actually purchased, go to the insurance company and request new policy documents for everything."
Bad experience with an insurance company and don't know where I stand?,miss_scorpio,1,"Just some random thoughts: 

Have you checked with your Financial Advisor - are they an agent of the insurance company - have they messed up? Arranging insurance for people is regulated activity, maybe the advisor did something wrong?

Under the Consumer Rights Directive firms have to offer a local rate phone number or 0800 so there should be one for you to call. If not they are breaking the law.

If the insurance is in the name of your other half then I would expect the company to contact them even if you were the one making the communication - otherwise you can get in to situations where they act on the instructions of someone being malicious or fraudulent.

When you ring tell them you wish to make an expression of dissatisfaction and you have suffered material distress and inconvenience. They are obliged to investigate and manage it, if you don't get a satisfactory response you can escalate to the Financial Ombudsman.

Decreasing life insurance is often a condition of the mortgage, critical illness, well, I have family history of conditions that are covered under it, so I have it. I think many people with no family history don't bother because it's quite narrow in what it considers to be a critical illness."

Getting an idea about quality of life and cost of living in Cheshire (potential job opportunity near Warrington)?,buried_treasure,1,"Runcorn is a New Town. These were planned towns, laid out in the decades following World War Two, primarily to provide good quality housing for working class people from inner city areas: the inner cities had been either blown to smithereens during the war or were bulldozed en masse as part of post-war slum clearance programmes.

To this day the New Towns divide opinion in the UK: some feel that they are soulless, artificial and uninspiring. Others find them pleasant places to live as pedestrians and vehicle traffic tend to be separated, roads are well-planned and it's easy to get in and out, with quiet residential areas. To be honest I think there's also an element of snobbery: because the first occupants of the New Towns were working class people they gained a bit of a reputation as places that were a bit ""rough and ready"" but even if that was the case, we're going back 40-50 years: generations have literally grown up in these towns now.

I've never lived in Runcorn but it's certainly well-placed for access to Daresbury: in fact it's probably easier to get there from Runcorn than from Warrington. I certainly wouldn't rule it out, as you said you're planning to rent initially anyway there's very little reason to shy away from an entire town like that."

Would you say buying property around there is a good investment at all? I've only bought a house once before and lost money on it when I needed to move after 5 years.  Around here people think it's some law of nature that prices will only go up up up. I'm also curious because the job is in a sort of internal startup venture separated but funded by its global parent company and I'm a bit worried about it not working out and the funding drying up after some number of years, which would likely necessitate me moving for another job elsewhere since I doubt there is more than one role like this in the entire region heh."

Replacing a cable is usually pretty simple, I've replaced one on mine and all I had to do was remove a pin and take the cone off the top bar and replace it with a new one (with cable already attached). 

I'd take a look and ascertain the problem first - it could have just popped out of the guides and needs a shove to get it back in.

A landlord is avoiding paying council tax - am I liable for tax evasion?,[deleted],19,[deleted]
A landlord is avoiding paying council tax - am I liable for tax evasion?,syntax,5,">  The landlord deliberately hasn't registered the house with the council as a permanent residence since it stopping being a holiday home, so there is no council tax.

Holiday homes are taxed at 50% (variable, up to 100% dependant on area) for council tax. https://www.gov.uk/council-tax/second-homes-and-empty-properties

Likewise, empty houses attract council tax, but at a similarly reduced rate.

The idea that they were paying nothing 'because it was a holiday home' doesn't stack up.


Council tax is a burden on the _occupants_ of the property, not the owner.  See, e.g. http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/council-tax/who-pays-council-tax

If you live there, and it's incorrectly assessed, they you would be liable for the tax.  I would not move in there without letting the council know that you have moved in, and then let the council sort it out.

Although: given that this would very likely sour the relationship with the landlord, I probably just plain wouldn't take the place.  And report them."
A landlord is avoiding paying council tax - am I liable for tax evasion?,[deleted],3,"> My question is - how much of this is my problem? I know it is the tenant's responsibility to pay council tax, but is it the tenant's responsibility to get the property correctly assessed by the council? 

Yes.

> Would I be liable through knowing about it and not reporting it?

You would be liable for not contacting the council tax office to tell them you'd moved in. "
A landlord is avoiding paying council tax - am I liable for tax evasion?,Thestolenone,3,"We moved into a flat in the very centre of a town, in a small street with no other residents, all the properties had been converted to things like clinics and solicitors. We couldn't find any details of council tax so we contacted the council and they said they had no record of the property, they sent someone round to do a very quick assessment and they put us in a (very low) band. The previous tenant lived there for 8 years and must have paid no council tax at all! We were part kicking ourselves for drawing attention to the flat and part relieved we wouldn't get into trouble for not telling the council about the flat. The property owner and the letting agents were livid! They were trouble all round and we left as soon as possible anyway. So basically, you can get away with it but not worth the stress of worrying about being caught."
A landlord is avoiding paying council tax - am I liable for tax evasion?,[deleted],3,"You'll be liable to pay the council tax for the time you've been living in that property. As a tenant it's your responsibility to inform the council about you living there for council tax purposes.

Anything else that your landlord has been doing with your house or other ones isn't really your concern. 

They aren't going to take you to court for his wrongdoing (but then if you don't inform the council about your tenancy then of course you could also be breaking the rules.)"

> given that this would very likely sour the relationship with the landlord

That's definitely the problem. I'd also be slightly worried that  wouldn't just be getting the landlord in trouble, but all other previous tenants in the house, and the other houses on the sites, that's tens of families, as surely they'd all be liable for the council tax they were meant to have paid."

I'd happilly move in and alert the council as you did but the landlord lives right next door - if they're as livid as your owners, that could get interesting! I think i'll just forget the whole thing and move on to somewhere less dodgy..."
A landlord is avoiding paying council tax - am I liable for tax evasion?,tax_pedant,2,"Okay thanks. I'd happily move in and let the council know, but the landlord is obviously not going to appreciate that one bit. I'm also slightly conscious of the fact that if I alert them about this house, all four other houses on the site will likely be assessed as well. That's a lot of current tenants/previous tenants liable for probably a large amount of unpaid council tax. That's probably not going to create a nice living situation... I think I'll just avoid the whole dodgy business and go elsewhere."
