Building Insurance confusion ,itsBonder,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1da9dv3/building_insurance_confusion/,"I'm confused with building insurance and was hoping someone could help me out.

We have had an offer accepted on a house, advisor locking in mortgage and solicitors set up. However to  lock in the mortgage we apparently need building insurance. The quote she's given seems to be a lot higher, almost double, what I can found online.

However you can't select a start date for the insurance beyond 30 days, and we're likely more than 2 months away from exchange. Can I purchase this insurance seeing as we won't legally be the owners at the start of the cover? "

Question about building insurance,frostycab,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1cqebqx/question_about_building_insurance/,"Hiya. First-time homeowner, which I only mention to explain my lack of knowledge.

I live in a Victorian villa which has been converted in to 5 flats. I live on the first floor, with 2 flats directly below mine. One of the flats knocked on my door saying there was water coming through the ceiling, so I immediately turned off the incoming supply to my flat. It seems as though the leak had been there for some time, but went unnoticed as the owners were away for a couple of weeks, and the leak was going into a cavity where the ceiling had been lowered which may have held it back for a while.

This could turn out to be an expensive repair. I'm wondering if this is something that building insurance would typically pay for. The flats are managed by the owners, which is to say that there is a management company set up, but we meet and agree on such things as service charges and expenses. The person dealing with all running of all this has basically said it will be down to me to liaise with the other flat to fix the leak and make repairs, and that it will probably be me that has to pay for it. 

Like I said, I'm new to this and thought that this is normally something that building insurance would have to cover, or is it purely for things like fires, earthquakes and other acts of God? I've not even lived here for 3 months yet. "

Building insurance and freeholder,Successful_Bee4750,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1e4llsu/building_insurance_and_freeholder/,"Hi Everyone,

First of all, apologies if this question was answered before, I used the search bar but couldn't find an answer.

We recently bought the leasehold on a flat, and with the recent rain, noticed a water leak starting to cause damage to the ceiling.

I feel like this is something the building insurance company can cover, so I tried to contact them, but they will only talk to the freeholder, who's name is the only contact on the insurance contract.

We do not have an email address not phone number to easily talk to the freeholder, instead, I have:

* Her address
* The email address of her lawyer, mentioned in the conveyancer pack as her ""management company"", with a mention ""for collection of Ground Rent and insurance rent only""

So my questions are:

* In this situation, am I right to think the insurance company should be contacted?
* If so, should I write a letter to the freeholder? Is there any legan mention I should specify? Should I contact the ""managing company"" (even though they only collect the ground rent for her)? Or contact both?

thanks!

Leaseholders with very high building insurance premiums,idanyd,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/19d16pp/leaseholders_with_very_high_building_insurance/,"Hello,

We're the leaseholders of a house (not a flat) in a development in London.

According to the lease, the freeholder is responsible for taking care of the building insurance, for which the leaseholders pay.

Ever since we bought the place its premiums have been high, at over £1,000 (for a 3-bedroom house, estimated at about £400,000). This year the premium was no less than £1,400.

According to the freeholder, the reasons the premium is this high are:

a. The entire development is covered under the same policy, so any claims made by our neighbours cause an increase in the premium

b. To protect the freeholder, the level of cover is much higher than the one I'd find on a standard policy

Now, I appreciate that freeholders may use this clause in the lease to mark the premiums up somewhat, but this just seems exorbitant.

So what I'd like to know is - is this considered a standard premium for a leasehold property. If not, is there something I can do about it, which won't cost me an (additional) arm and/or leg?

FTB: Should Service charge include Building Insurance???,Legitimate_Ask309,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/15r3485/ftb_should_service_charge_include_building/,"My partner and I are FTB in England-Bristol we are in the process of buying a property (2 months in) We received a lot of information from the solicitor today, which included the service charge information. The property was advertised with a £1600 service charge, The estate agent documents stated this and this is what our mortgage offer is based on. It's important to note that building cladding remedial work is required, although the developer has agreed to cover the cost, no start date has been given.To our surprise, the statement of Account document we received indicates a service charge amount that is significantly higher than anticipated. Upon investigation, it appears that the original service charge figure provided does not include the Building Insurance. Is this normal, considering the additional cost of just over £2k? on top of the original £1.6k. We have informed the estate agent that we will likely pull out of the sale, as we don't have the funds to cover such an expense. especially, with no end date in sight.

The .gov page on leasehold properties states:""Your landlord will usually be responsible for insurance of the building (not the contents) - this will be part of your service charge.""Therefore surely the information given was incorrect.

Building insurance is £1400/yr. Are we being ripped off?,Mysterious_Grape_427,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ax856w/building_insurance_is_1400yr_are_we_being_ripped/,"(Scotland)

Hello, I bought a tenement flat in Glasgow last year and the factor who manages the building also handles our building insurance. They are charging the owners around £10,000 a year for buildings insurance, around £1400/yr for each owner, or £110/month. This seems incredibly high to me. After looking online and asking friends it seems the cost shouldn't be more than a few hundred per year per person? My flat costs \~£250,000 and I guess the other flats in the building will be similar. The factor has been very difficult so far when we have questioned the insurance, essentially refusing to change it, claiming they use an insurance broker (""Marsh"") to ""find the most competitive rates"", and are doing their best to serve us. Is this normal or ubsurdly high?

Also appreciated is any advice on how we can force the factor to change the insurance broker they are using for us, or in the worst case dismiss the factor to find a new one. Do us the owners have the right to vote for them to change insurance? Can we force them to stop handling the insurance entirely and each owner take out a seperate policy? Or is it completely up to them since we appointed them, and we just need to dismiss them if they won't help. Any advice appreciated

Edit: I have just dug out the old insurance documents and in 2016 they were charging £375/yr/person. Thats a 360% increase in the last 8 years. Surely that can't be right?"

Do I have to declare a failed subsidence claim when looking for building insurance?,input,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1c4keee/do_i_have_to_declare_a_failed_subsidence_claim/,"We are around two weeks away from exchange on a 1930s house in a clay area *(London, England)* and I've become a worried about insuring the building, I am under the impression we do not have to declare it as the insurance company decline it in 2022 with the following statement:

> ""The engineer has confirmed that there is no evidence of recent or progressive subsidence damage to the property, and there is no cover for the cost of repairs under the subsidence section of the policy.""

The report details that ""The damage is related to floor joist movement and historical repairs and thermal movement.""

In response to this the seller then completed a independant structual report and remideal building works to address the structual issues discovered to be the cause of the issue in early/mid 2023, which included:

- Repairs in the undercroft (rebuilding 4 debonded brick piers, new central cross sleeper wall with lintel to support failed widened central cross wall )
- Repair interior / exterior cracks

This work has been complete, the seller has provided a letter from the builder stating it was done to the specifications of the inpendant survey findings, it was however flagged in my level 3 report:

> ""In addition, in the cellar it is apparent that sleeper walls and brick piers have been rebuilt at some time in the
past to provide more reliable support to the walls and suspended timber floors. These
structural improvements have been effective. Normally, Building Regulations approval would be required for
such structural alterations, and we recommend that your conveyancer makes the necessary enquiries to
establish whether Building Regulations approval was sought and granted. If no formal consent was given, a
structural engineer should be appointed to assess the suitability, strength and stability of the sleeper walls and
brick piers.""

My conveyancer found no building regulations were granted, so asking the seller to get the original surveyor to sign it off, our surveyor didn't know the history but from my own research building regulations are only needed for removal, not increasing support anyway seems like a good idea to have it checked over again.

---

Anyway last week I instructed a independant insurance broker as sugested by my conveyancer and provided supporting documents saying it is not subsidence, they're sending them to the underwriter today and their phone call is stressing me out, they said: ""We have to declare subsidence due to the area being at risk of subsidence in your report"", I have not seen that anywhere the only place is some ass covering in the level 3 report:

> ""The purchaser will have to accept the risk that significant cracking may occur at some point in the future with subsidence becoming increasingly common due to long periods of dry weather.""

The two questions that are asked when doing an online quotes are, which I think both are no:

* The property has not previously been underpinned or otherwise had its foundation reinforced - no because a sleeper wall isn't foundations
* The property has never shown any signs of or been monitored for subsidence, landslip or heave - no because the claim was rejected


I have discussed this with my conveyancer and they agree with my assumptions, in hindsight I should have looked at insurance earlier, but now I am somewhat worried, what are your thoughts?"

Camera is to check that nothing got on fire when not there

This property is a proper “do-er upper” therefore we would be still living with my partner’s parents whilst we are doing the work in the meantime.

As a result of it being unoccupied, I know that we now have to get specific building insurance as the property is not being lived in for over 30 days. 

We have also found out that there is a (minor) case of active woodworm in the loft of the property. When talking to our insurance brokers, this now counts as an ‘infestation’ and the property is classed as being in a ‘bad state of repair’, meaning that the majority of companies won’t insure us. And even if we were to treat it, it can take up to 12 months to no longer count as being ‘active’.

The only buildings insurance that we can find is incredibly limited in what it covers, we want it to be as comprehensive as possible.

So our problem is, is there an easy way around this? 
Surely we’re not the only people in the country that have needed buildings insurance on an unoccupied property that has active woodworm in it… right?👀

Leasehold Building Insurance Extortionate,raspberryjams,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/103v3px/leasehold_building_insurance_extortionate/,"Hi,

I'm a FTB and I have been in my flat for a year now. The service charges are high but manageable. 

However, 2 days ago I received a demand for insurance payment of £583 due on the 13/01. Now the landlord contacted me earlier in the year saying they had conducted a valuation of the property (which cost me £250) and that I should expect higher premiums in the new year.

Now this is the first time the landlord has asked for insurance so I am surprised to see it's this much considering the price is split between 18 flats equally (583*18) and yet not all of the flats are the same size (3 bed flats on the top floors) 

Having dug a little deeper into the landlord and his company it seems to be a family run money making machine with a huge portfolio of properties they are creating silly invoices for. (For example, my front door does not close properly (as per a fire safety inspection check which was £45) and they wanted £350 to plane the bottom!

I feel like I'm locked in with this as I had my offer accepted in May 2021 during peak covid pricing and selling now would likely mean taking a loss. 

I've heard legislation is meant to be tackling this but I can see it getting buried under all of the other stress the UK is under."
Building Insurance for Mortgage,Smidgenp1e,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/wlw68p/building_insurance_for_mortgage/,"So, we need to get building insurance for our leasehold flat for our mortgage to be approved. The one arranged by our mortgage advisor had errors and was set up for a freehold property. Their insurance company (only one they work with) will not cover leasehold properties. She advised me to look on a comparison site and arrange it myself. 
On speaking to the solicitors, they nearly pitched a fit as the insurance MUST protect the mortgage lenders interests and therefore they need to be named on it. This is not something you can do through a comparison site. 

I have two questions:- 
1: Where can I go to get help to sort this? We have a very very short deadline.

Freeholder building insurance cost,PoglesBee,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/xx3476/freeholder_building_insurance_cost/,"Hello!

We bought our flat in February 2022, a maisonette in a 2 storey house that's been converted to 2 flats. There was a lot of confusion around the freehold at the time - it was advertised as freehold. When it came to the process of buying, it turned out that both flats are technically leasehold, but whoever owns the top flat (us) owns the freehold to the whole building. We fought for a long time to get this clarified, but our solicitors barely seemed to understand what was happening. There was a small amount of ground rent due from the other flat, and an agreement that they would pay half the buildings insurance. 

We are getting quotes for this year (early, as we are expecting a baby at renewal time and I don't want to forget) and they have been in the region of £650. Is that normal/reasonable? Friends of ours own in similar sized properties, but as a complete house, and their premium is closer to £200. All the quote paperwork that we have filled out seems to expect us to be a company or landlord not resident in the building. We're just a couple who it turned out owned the whole freehold when we bought the property! 

Is there a specific kind of insurance we should be getting? Any particular brokers you would recommend for something like this? We have been getting wishy washy non answers from everyone about this since we bought the flat, solicitors, estate agents, insurance brokers...everything is difficult. We can't easily use comparison sites because of the situation, so it's really hard to know if this is a fair price or not. It feels like we're missing a piece of info!

Share of freehold building insurance,ula_em_wu,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/zdeasq/share_of_freehold_building_insurance/,"I own a flat in a Victorian conversion (4 flats in total) and we are due to renew the policy. Our quote seems incredibly high (just under £2000 per year) for a joint insurance for all flats. One of the flats is being rented out and the remaining 3 are occupied by owners.

All of us have a leasehold as well as share of freehold (strangely, the proportions divided differently for both) and we can never agree on how to split the cost - should it be done according to the freehold proportion, leasehold proportion, size of property, or just evenly between all.

With the high quote I have done a little bit of reading and it seems that we could just have individual covers for each property - **is this true?**

For me this would mean a much lower quote and my mortgage provider has nothing against it. I can't see anything in my lease that would require us to have a joint policy.

**Does anyone know is individual insurance policies can be done in this case and how does it work in terms of communal areas (in our case an entry hall). Also what happens if eg. the roof leaks, but not all flats are affected by it. Can I have an individual cover for my flat but specify that I also want to insure the communal hallway and the roof (even though my flat does not have a roof immediately over)?**

Buildings insurance between exchange and completion,h4xtbh,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/12ekyu7/buildings_insurance_between_exchange_and/,"We're about to exchange contracts on a house and will be completing around 8 weeks later. We need to buy buildings insurance for the period between exchange and completion - at which point we'll amend or take out a different policy.

After checking comparison sites and speaking to insurers directly we've found that none of the mainstream insurers we've spoken to offer this type of buildings insurance because:

* It's not our primary residence
* We don't yet own the property (we're legally bound to buy it, but we don't legally own it until completion)
* It's occupied by the current owners  (but there are products for unoccupied properties and new builds)

If we took out a conventional buildings insurance policy we'd be screwed in the event of a claim through not meeting the basic criteria above.

Can anyone recommend an insurer that has a product that covers house buying between exchange and completion?  


**UPDATE:** After doing further research and making more calls to insurers:  


* We now have insurance through **Urban Jungle**. They offer month-by-month cover which you can cancel at any time and amendments/cancellation are free.
* Spoke to **LV** based on u/ICThat's recommendation. Their standard building insurance can be used but only if you are completing within 60 days of exchange. Perfect for us, but their quote was prohibitively expensive.
* **Exchange2Completion** (catchy name!) offer bespoke insurance for this purpose, but you must have had a professional survey completed within 16 weeks of taking out the policy - which, in our case, was longer than that - otherwise subsidence/heaving/etc. is not covered, and that's typically a dealbreaker for a mortgage company. The quote was a bit high for such a short period, but at least you'd be dealing with an insurance company that deals with these specific types of policy/claims.
* **Intelligent insurance** have an *""I have not moved in yet""* option. Price was good for the year but the compulsorary excess numbers were ridiculously high.

Some general tips based on some things I saw on many sites:  


* Make sure you're given an opportunity to name an ""interested/connected party"" on the application - if you're taking out a mortgage, this will be your bank or building society. They're buying your house too! Some sites didn't ask this question.
* Make sure excesses are clear and obvious to you. Some sites ""hid"" these behind links (I'm looking at you, Intelligent Insurance). Some excesses may also be covered in an endorsements section, e.g. a higher excess speicifcally for storm damage.
* If you're taking out a long policy with the intention of cancelling not long after, you'll typically pay a fee (e.g. £60) if it's after the 14-day cooling off period.
* Check what's covered in detail. Got a flat roof? Most insurers will state that you're only covered if it's been inspected by a professional in the 12 months *prior* to taking out the policy and every X years after that. Drains, guttering and mains pipes covered? Not always - sometimes this is extra above the basic policy.
* If in doubt, call the insurance company. I spoke to many helpful people who were upfront about what the policy did and didn't cover. It's time-consuming, but you'll sleep better at night knowing you're definitely covered.
* Where possible, obtain a quote online. 99% of the time this will be cheaper compared to obtaining a quote by phone.

Building insurance arrangements for Victorian conversion flats with share of freehold. What are your arrangements?,Manoj109,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/17l66y8/building_insurance_arrangements_for_victorian/,"
What are your insurance arrangements if you live in block of flats with share of freehold?

Do you buy block insurance for the entire building or do you buy your own individual insurance? 

And how do you arrange block insurance if:

1. Some properties are bigger than others 


2. Some are owner occupied vs buy to let. Buy to let has higher premiums. 



For example :if you live in a block of flats with 2 flats in the building and have share of the freehold,if one is btl to let and the other is owner occupied is it better to get separate building insurance? 

What are the implications of separate building insurance? 


And if you have joint insurance for the entire block and one party made a claim, surely that will increase the premium for the other party. 


Share of freehold has its advantages but comes with hassle of the freeholder having to arrange stuff like insurance and needing permission from other freeholders to do any work. 

Having said that I will take share of freehold over not having the freehold.

Building Insurance buying a flat as a leaseholder?,--Casper-,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/10gqwh7/building_insurance_buying_a_flat_as_a_leaseholder/,"Hi everyone, apologies if this is a silly question but I am finding it hard to find a definitive answer.

I received information that the service charge includes building insurance that has been in place. 

As part of the mortgage offer it requires building insurance. As there is building insurance in place already, would the solicitor simply get the existing policy number to satisfy the mortgage condition? Or would I be required to take out building insurance for the first floor flat?

I own a share of freehold flat in a Victorian-era building that contains two flats overall (a house to flat conversion).

I was thinking about cancelling this and setting it up by myself. When I go on the comparison websites, it seems difficult to set this up as the forms always seem to assume that you are setting up your own property and not a shared property.

Which buildings insurance do I get to complement my service charge buildings insurance?,Thenon,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/nvyw8s/which_buildings_insurance_do_i_get_to_complement/,"I have a question about buildings insurance. If this belongs in a different subreddit instead, please let me know.  


I recently bought and moved into an ex-council flat in London. In case of a burst pipe or fire damage, I want an insurance that covers the costs of fixing such damage.  


 I understand that I need two types of insurance: Buildings insurance and Contents insurance.

1. Contents insurance covers the cost of any contents damaged as a result. For example, if the burst pipe causes a flood and that flood breaks my laptop, then the contents insurance will cover the cost of the laptop. However, it will not cover the cost of fixing the pipe or any resulting damage to the floors below.
2. Buildings insurance. This would cover any non-contents damage, such as fixing the pipe or damage to the floor below.

&#x200B;

Long story short, I am planning to skip contents insurance. Most of the valuable items in our flat are covered by my business insurance (I am videographer and have expensive camera equipment). The remaining value of all our items is under £10k. We are on the second floor with lockable windows and not in a flood zone.

&#x200B;

The question I have is about buildings insurance. As I am a leaseholder, I pay an annual service charge, about £300 of which goes to building insurance that the freeholder has organised. I don't want to buy my own standard buildings insurance, because I believe that there is overlap between the building insurance from the freeholder and hence I will be overpaying for things that are already covered.  


However, I strongly suspect that this service charge building insurance does not cover everything. If the roof breaks or if the communal boiler in the basement breaks, then I hope the freeholder's buildings insurance will cover that.  


However, if a pipe bursts in my own kitchen or if the fuse blows because I drilled a hole in the wrong place, then I suspect that the freeholder's insurance will not cover that. Hence, I am looking for a buildings insurance that covers those things. But I do NOT want to pay a premium to also cover the things that the freeholder has already covered.  


Does that make sense? Do you have any tips?  


I thought that my situation is fairly common, a lot of leaseholders in London have some kind of buildings insurance included in their service charge. However, I spent some time online making insurance quotes and also called up one company for a long discussion and they didn't seem to offer this.  


Thank you in advance."
Building insurance policy/accidental damage cover for leasehold flat,Leckere,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/vy7or1/building_insurance_policyaccidental_damage_cover/,"Hello, my partner and I are currently in the process of buying a leasehold flat. Our solicitor has raised that the freeholder's building insurance policy doesn't include accidental damage, and that she must inform our lender about this detail as it could affect our mortgage. We feel like this might not be necessary, and the sellers/sellers' solicitors/estate agent feel the same way (I know, I know, they would say that).

I'd never been familiar with the ins and outs of accidental damage before this whole process, but my understanding it it's stuff like cracking a bath tub or window pane and other damage to fixtures and fittings, but nothing massively serious. Apart from contents insurance, ofc I'm aware that we can't take up our own policy, but does anyone know of cover that would effectively work like accidental damage in a leasehold property?

> If we ask you and the insurance company allows you to, you must have your property insured in **our joint names**. If that is not possible, you must arrange for our interest in your property to be noted on the insurance policy.

I know there is an ""if"" at the beginning, but is this usual? Insuring the property like this?

Later, in another paragraph:

> If you get any money from a claim under any buildings insurance for your property, you must hold it all on ‘trust’ for us. This means you must keep it for us until it is used to repair or rebuild your property or to pay towards everything you owe.

They appear across the entire flat, across rooms. They’re evenly spaced. What’s weird though, is as they appeared, I’ve noticed that I can hear a lot more impact noise from the flat above.

I got the surveyor from the housing management association out – he said that it’s nothing to worry about and is just cosmetic, and is caused by the concrete slabs that make up the ceiling/floor between the flats have “settled” or shifted slightly, and it’s perfectly normal.

I might be paranoid, but I’m convinced that this is the cause of me being able to hear more impact noise from upstairs (perhaps this “shifting” of the concrete structure means that the floors are no longer “decoupled” and noise is now more able to transmit down).

Therefore, I want to make a claim on the building insurance for them to look at the problem properly.

However, my concern is: will I have to disclose to a potential buyer in the future when I did this? I can’t imagine it looking good to a buyer that I had concerns of the ceiling shifting and an increase in noise from above, especially when it’s very unlikely that the buildings insurance people will actually be able to fix the issue…

"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",FinalRecording3233,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ap38nq/landlord_has_no_home_insurance_leak_unknown_to_me/,"Hello all,

I’m at a bit of a loss what to do and seeking advice. I bought a leasehold flat 6 months ago. Last Wednesday I got an email while at work from my building management company which said a leak has been reported from my flat which has caused the ceiling to cave in on the flat below and gave me the contact details of the tenant in the flat. I immediately left work and contacted the tenant, I live a 5 minute walk away from work so arrived to the damaged flat within minutes. The tenant was aware of the leak for a few days, his ceiling fan started dripping whenever I was showering and the day before the ceiling caved his light fixture completely filled with water. I’m unsure why I wasn’t made aware of this until the ceiling fell through.

This is the first property I’ve owned and not experienced this before so I did just assume as this was from my flat I was liable for the damage so after stopping the water in my flat, I got the balling rolling with contacting my personal home insurance to fix the flat below. They advised me that actually the landlord of the flat below should be claiming off her own insurance to fix the damage. I contacted the landlord who was understandably not happy, and I advised her what I had been told from my insurance. She claimed she should not being doing that as it’s my fault the flat is damaged. 

She then contacted the management company who agreed with her, so I contacted the management company myself to confirm if this was the case. They said yes I’m liable for the damage out of pocket. To confirm, I was completely unaware of this leak. I asked the management company what do I pay personal insurance and a service charge for if I’m not even covered in these circumstances. I was then told I could see if the building insurance would cover it so they gave me the insurer details.

I contacted the insurer and they told me based on the information gave I have nothing to worry about, and once again advised that the landlord should be using her landlord home insurance to get the tenant support as soon as possible, and then can mitigate her losses through the building insurance. I informed the landlord of this right away. She was refusing to use her insurance but said she will arrange a builder to come to the flat. 

I arranged a plumber to come out to my flat (so the problem was fixed within 24 hours of it being reported to me), who confirmed a faulty waste pipe under my bath. I updated the landlord of this at 2pm the following day and then she asked if I wanted to arrange my own contractor to sort the damage in her flat, or her arrange her own and bill me the money. As this was the following day I’d been reading online that it’s the landlords responsibility and as I didn’t intentionally cause a leak (like overflowing the bath or leaving taps on), I’m not fully liable. I again informed her that two insurance companies have advised me the correct way to manage this is to use her insurance and told her I’d already opened up a claim with the building insurance. I gave her the insurance details and didn’t hear anything more from her. On Friday (the following day after my last conversation with the landlord), the tenant informed me builders have arrived to fix his ceiling. So it took two full days for the landlord to arrange fixing damage to her flat.

Today she has contacted me to ask if I’d contacted the freeholder to open a claim. This completely confused me as I’m not sure why I’d be contacting the owner of building? She then told me she has not contacted the building insurance and I’ve just found out the landlord doesn’t have home insurance for the flat at all.

The damages are £800 so far. If she doesn’t have home insurance, what are the options here? Will the building insurance pay out directly to her if I’m covered? I understand a leak came from my flat, but as mentioned it wasn’t from my nuisance or negligence. This is really stressing me out (as I’m sure it is for the landlord) but dealing with a landlord that doesn’t seem to be aware of their responsibilities as a landlord is causing even more stress .

Have I misunderstood my duties here and I’m actually in the wrong? Should I be paying the £800 out of goodwill, or wait for the building insurance outcome? Any advice at all on how to proceed would be appreciated."

The latest info I've been told though is that the freeholder also takes out insurance on behalf of the downstairs flat...it's the same insurance covering one building with two maisonettes.

I'm assuming this is incompetence that I am trying to get cleared up, but could there be anything malicious in it? I noticed the slightly wrong address when I first got the paperwork when I bought it, but my lawyers said that it wasn't an issue as the number and postcode were correct. Would having two policies be an issue should anything go wrong? They seem to be insured by the same company."

Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,PurpleRainOnTPlain,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1dazrkj/question_about_having_home_insurance_between/,"Hello,

I am due to exchange on a flat on Monday and would then have 1-2 weeks between exchange and completion. I have read that it's important to ensure you have home insurance from the point of exchange as by that point you are legally responsible for the property. But I'm a bit confused about what ""home insurance"" means.

It is a leasehold flat so the property has building insurance, paid for as part of the service charge. It is a requirement of my mortgage that the property has building insurance, so the fact my solicitor has not explicitly told me to take out insurance must mean they are satisfied that this would meet the mortgage requirements, right?

Is the above advice only referring to building insurance, or will I i also need to take out contents insurance from the exchange date onwards? What happens if for instance, during the gap between exchange and completion, there is a leak and that ruins the carpet? Or the boiler breaks?

I viewed the flat for a 'final' time 2 weeks ago as I was told we would be exchanging the following day, however a last minute issue in the chain delayed things. Everything seemed fine on that viewing, however I live a considerable distance away and it's not really feasible to do another viewing before Monday. If, on completion, it transpires that there are issues which weren't present when I last viewed it (for instance if the boiler were to break), how does this all play out and would it differ if the issue occurred before exchange versus after exchange and who has the onus of proof upon them?

I don't have any specific reasons to be concerned, but have read horror stories and so  am just feeling very unsure about this brief period where I am legally responsible for the property, but don't actually live there and have no control over things.

Thanks!"
Should I buy a flat inside a timber framed building in London?,Such_End6669,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bi5kmg/should_i_buy_a_flat_inside_a_timber_framed/,"Hi everyone, 

I’m a first-time buyer in the process of purchasing my first home in London. I received my home survey report last week and it suggests that the flat I’m buying is located inside a timber framed building - something I wasn’t aware of. The report emphasises that since the building is timber framed, it may mean the property is less mortgageable and saleable than I want it to be. There may also be building insurance issues.

I’m not sure if I should pull out from the purchase now. While I like the flat, I don’t want to struggle to  sell it in the future. Yet my own mortgage application has already been approved so it’s hard for me to gauge how difficult it is to get a mortgage on the property in general.

In terms of building insurance, I’m not sure if I have anything to worry about since I was told that building insurance would be included in the service charge.

Any advice would be much appreciated!"

💭 Feedback on a new product to protect homebuyers 🏡,-Homewell,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/18rforj/feedback_on_a_new_product_to_protect_homebuyers/,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m working on developing a new type of insurance product specifically designed for homebuyers, and I could really use r/HousingUK’s thoughts.

We’re building a product to protect homeowners from unforeseen costs that aren't typically covered by standard home or building insurance (or by surveyors or estate agents who may or may not have flagged them), such as building repairs or legal disputes post-purchase. The aim is to provide something that’d let people buy their home with peace of mind, knowing they’re protected for a period of time chosen by them.

If you’re someone who’s bought a home (or are thinking about it), it’d be great to hear your thoughts on the below:

**1. Have you encountered any unexpected costs after purchasing your home?**

**2. How did these costs impact your financial situation?**

**3. Would you have considered purchasing insurance that specifically covers unforeseen post-purchase costs?**

**4. What features or assurances would you look for in such an insurance product?**

Any thoughts or comments, positive or negative, will help us create something which we hope can genuinely protect people as they buy their home.

Thanks so much!"
What would the alternative to Leasehold flats be?,Keywi1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bk280m/what_would_the_alternative_to_leasehold_flats_be/,"I’ve often heard people say the system should be abolished, but I was thinking about it and think it has the following benefits:

- If repairs need to be carried out this is arranged by the building manager. Building insurance is also arranged by them. 
- There is no need for people living in the building to communicate with each other.
- The service charge is probably a good thing (in theory at least), as it pays for maintenance which should stop major repairs being needed later. It also pays for the cleaner etc. How could this be arranged otherwise.

There are probably more, but the only negative I can think of is the time of lease remaining? So if just this aspect is abolished and ownership is permanent, would this be all that is required to make it an acceptable system for most people?

"Any advice appreciated, first time buyer ***LONG POST***",Jberry999,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1aq357w/any_advice_appreciated_first_time_buyer_long_post/,"Currently in the process of purchasing my first home. It’s was built in 1930. The house has a loft conversion which cannot be used or advertised as a bedroom, but I only plan on using it for storage. However I am running into a lot of issues and wondering whether at this point it’s best to pull out. The loft is pretty big, has a skylight window and a staircase leading to the first floor. My solicitor and the sellers solicitor have been going back and fourth for months. I put the offer in on the house in September. The seller is unable to provide any planning or building regulations as it was done before they moved in. Here is what my solicitor is saying:


With reference to the above matter, the loft conversion remains a matter of concern due to the lack of building regulations approval.
 
These works amount to a significant structural alteration to the property and pose two concerns:
 
1. Whilst the works may be outside of the statutory enforcement period of one year, if the works are deemed to be unsafe, there is no enforcement period. It may be possible to protect against the risk of legal enforcement with a legal indemnity insurance policy.
 
However, this insurance would only provide cover against the cost of legal enforcement in the event that legal action was taken. It will not cover the cost of any remedial works as a result of the defect.
 
If you choose to proceed with indemnity insurance, you will be unable to disclose the policy to anybody, including the Building Control Department. Should you wish to carry out further works in the future that require Building Regulations, you may invalidate the insurance in inviting the Inspector to review your other works.
 
You would need to fund the cost of the policy if the Sellers refuse to pay for it.
 
2. The second is the issue of safety. Building Regulations exist to provide some security that works covered by the Regulations are safe and pose no threat to life. In the absence of a Building Regulations Completion Certificate we have no evidence that the works are safe. This may pose a risk to you and any other occupiers of the property. You may also find that your building insurance policy is invalidated as a consequence.
 
Additionally, should you wish to let the property out in the future, you must ensure that the property is fit and safe for any prospective tenants. Should a tenant be injured or worse, you may face both civil and criminal liability for allowing the property to be let despite it being unsafe.
 
Our advice therefore is to insist on a Regularisation Certificate (retrospective inspection certificate) but the Sellers are likely to resist this and we accept that you may not wish to pursue this route.
 
You should consider making enquiries with your surveyor as to their opinion on the structural adequacy of the works. You may need to instruct a further full structural survey.
 
Should you decide that you are happy to accept the risk and proceed with legal indemnity insurance, we will need to report this matter to your lender and ask them to refer it to their surveyor. They may request further surveys, at your cost, or they may decline to lend.
 
We have asked the seller’s solicitor to provide a draft indemnity insurance policy in this instance as we understand an application for a regularisation certificate was applied for but you understood from the seller that they were told by the local authority that the works did not meet current standards and that an indemnity insurance policy should be taken out. This is unusual for the party who can carry out enforcement proceedings to recommend an insurance policy against themselves. We have asked for further information and for a draft policy to be provided once full disclosure has been made to the indemnity insurers of the approach and the response received.
 
You should also be aware that the loft room cannot be classed as a habitable room until such time as it is brought up to current standards and a regularisation certificate obtained; until such time, you could not class it as an additional room for valuation purposes.
 
We have asked the sellers lawyers to confirm what has been said with the council. If you are happy to proceed without the regularisation certificate we can refer the matter to your lender to ensure they are happy i.e. this would not affect their valuation, are you happy for us to do this?"

Does my contents insurance cover damage to the flat below if my washing machine floods?,devtastic,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bvrax9/does_my_contents_insurance_cover_damage_to_the/,"This is really another version of ""what insurance do I need for my flat in England?"". 

* I know the freeholder's building insurance covers a lot of leaks in communal areas, but definitely not pipes or the washing machine within my flat. 
* I assume that if my washing machine flooded and damaged my flat then my contents insurance would cover all or some of that damage.
* My question is: If the water damaged the flat downstairs would that damage also be covered by my contents insurance? Would it act a bit like third party insurance for a car?

I'm surprised how hard it is to find an answer to this. There are posts here covering similar scenarios, but they are the mostly from the perspective on the leaked on rather than the leaker, or they don't specify what type of insurance was involved, or they end up as a general discussion about buildings insurance vs contents insurance.

I just want to understand if my contents insurance would only cover damage to my contents or whether it would also cover third party damage, i.e, the flat downstairs. If my washing machine flooded and brought the ceiling down in the flat below would my contents insurance cover that?

How to deal with this loft issue?,Careful_Sort_9210,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1czs7o4/how_to_deal_with_this_loft_issue/,"Hi,

I am in the process of buying a house (in England) that has a converted loft. The loft is currently used as a bedroom with an ensuite bathroom. However, the seller has not been able to provide Planning Consent or Building Regulation Approval for the conversion.

The seller mentioned that she bought the house in the late 1980s, and the loft was already converted at that time. She did not receive any certificates from the previous owner.

Here are the pros and cons of the situation as I see it:

Pros:

* The loft is in good visible condition, according to a survey.
* It has been in use for many years without any issues as it seems.
* An indemnity insurance policy may not be necessary as the local authority is unlikely to enforce regulations after 4 years, though it may still be needed to satisfy a lender.
* The lender has agreed to mortgage the house without raising any questions about the loft.

Cons/Concerns:

* There is no guarantee that the loft was built safely or to the standards of that time.
* Future lenders might consider the loft uninhabitable, which could decrease the house's value or result in difficulty obtaining a mortgage.
* Building insurance may refuse to pay in case of a claim, arguing that the loft was not safe.

These are the main points I have considered. What would you advise in this situation?"

Insuring a flat?,JollyPhysics1394,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/170ot8l/insuring_a_flat/,"Longish read; TLDR at the end!

Hi! Not sure this is the right forum for this question but here goes! I live in a block of flats (leasehold), moved in about ten years ago, the building itself is eighteen years old. When buying insurance I was told I can only get contents insurance, as I don’t technically own the building to get building insurance. We pay a monthly fee to a building maintenance company whose job it is to affect repairs to communal areas and the external face of the building.

My neighbour was in the process of having a new shower installed, during which some tiles needed to be removed. Apparently his plumber was aghast at what he saw underneath- very little waterproofing, wet/damp plasterboard and insulation, and not really enough timber battens for a wall of that type. He said that a single flaw in the mastic around the bathtub meant that water from the shower got in the walls and mucked everything up. The plumber thinks the issue was simply shoddy workmanship and corner-cutting on the part of the builder, and to fix the damage would cost at least £4000.

As the building is over ten years old, my neighbour has no recourse to seek damages from the builder, and because he has contents insurance only, it doesn’t cover the damage to the structure of the walls. The maintenance company can’t help as their contract doesn’t cover inside the individual flats (except for ducting and pipe work).

I’m now worried this could happen to me and end up having to fork out £4K to fix my walls. I have re-pointed my bathtub but am still worried about the state of the walls beneath the bathroom tiles. Is there any sort of insurance I could take out that would cover me for any such future damage?

My flat is in England.

TLDR, neighbour in block of flats just spent £4K to fix his ruined bathroom wall; how can I mitigate against the same issue befalling my flat?"

Still awaiting full report but surveyor told me the actual flat is in good nick, no major issues - but there is evidence of a potential insurance claim against subsidence on the porchway of the building. 

This structure was an add onto to the main building, I’m assuming when it was converted into flats years and years ago. So the actual building in which the flat is isn’t affected structurally but it’s obviously part of the building. 

Surveyor told me to get solicitors to check what’s going on as the EA and buyer apparently know nothing about it. Surveyor couldn’t tell if it was a resolved issue or not.

I’m panicking about whether it’ll be impossible to get building insurance and also if it’ll affect me further down the line when I come to sell?

Leasehold - Trees in Garden,cabkid,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bun80v/leasehold_trees_in_garden/,"So me and my boyfriend are first time buyers and we recently had an offer accepted on a flat in a period property in SW London.  It is a leasehold, with around 155 years left, no ground rent, and only building insurance / ad hoc maintenance for service charge.

We had a survey, and it came back ‘as expected for a property of this age in this location’.  Few flags of potentially dampness and repointing but nothing majorly concerning.  The most concerning aspect was the fact there are two mature yew trees in the front garden.  We didn’t think much of this when we viewed, as they looked just like privets.  However, the surveyor warned us this could be problematic due to the potential shallow foundations of the house.  They do look like they have chunky trunks too… There is no obvious damage to the building but the boundary wall is cracked, which is directly next to trees.  Trees are a couple of metres from house.

The surveyor suggested we look into the building insurance terms to check whether damage by the trees is covered and also get a tree management strategy for the trees to get an expert opinion on them.  We are still awaiting full details regarding what’s currently in place for the trees, but I’m wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation?  The garden where the trees are located it included on our lease (apparently) but I’m guessing we would still need the freeholder’s permission to do any work etc. in this regard.  Although originally I was pleased to see that there was no ridiculously high service charge, in a way it is concerning however, because if there are no fees it is unlikely there will be anything in place for the maintenance of the trees and the freeholder will be most likely not very ‘present’.  We also don’t want to face any major difficulties selling in a few years…

Pet contents insurance as a tenant,OkArcher3701,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/164ebdx/pet_contents_insurance_as_a_tenant/,"Landlord has given us permission to have a dog on a trial basis in agreement that there will be insurance on fixtures and fittings to cover any potential damage.

Does anyone know of any insurers that would provide contents insurance for pets to cover fixtures and fittings? Was under the impression this would have been more commonly available due to the changes in tenant rights and having pets coming in next year. Thanks in advance for any advice."
Chimney Breast Removed - no other building regulations. What next for a lost FTB?,eggpufflett,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ec333k/chimney_breast_removed_no_other_building/,"Hi all

I’m a ftb looking to purchase an end terrace (built approx 1930). In general this house is well looked after and has generally good bones. The structural survey report had very few issues for a property of its age. 

My offer has been accepted, mortgage offer approved, level 3 survey done. Part of the survey report suggested to make sure proper building regulation is provided for the rear chimney breast removal, a rear extension and a loft conversion. 

My solicitor has came back with the searches and queries. We have building regulations for the rear extension and loft conversion.  But no building regulation for the rear chimney breast removal. 

The seller has rejected the idea of getting local council to do a retrospective approval. They stated work was done over 20 years ago and basically said take it or leave it. 

I don’t know how to proceed now! Regulation is a nightmare. On one hand I would like all the official paperwork to be in place. On the other hand I would like to get this purchase done asap. My current options are

1) Get a structural engineer to assess and confirm work done was adequate and sound. This will delay the process and the sellers are kinda getting impatient because the searches took ages to get back. 

2) Carry in w purchase. Once I have the property in my name, seek retrospective approval and accept the risk that more work is required. Although I don’t know if my building insurance will be valid if I bought the house knowing that building regulations are not in place

3) ignore the fact that no building regulation is in place. I’ve heard from many people regulations are a nightmare and it’s impossible to keep up w regulations for work done many years ago! Just because there is no approval, doesn’t mean chimney is not well supported. My solicitor said this is a very common issue

Confused About Leasehold with Zero Ground Rent and No Service Charge - Need Advice,ThessEmperor,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1eaabxj/confused_about_leasehold_with_zero_ground_rent/,"Hi everyone,

I had a offer accepted for a flat in London. The property is a basement flat in a three-storey mid terrace house and appears to have been constructed in the late 1800s. I was initially told it was a shared freehold, but it turns out it’s actually leasehold. However, I was told there’s zero ground rent and no service charge, and I only pay £50 a month building insurance.

I’m a bit confused about how this works. Is it common for leasehold properties to have no ground rent or service charges? How does this setup usually function, especially with the freehold potentially being shared with the owner of the other flat?

I’d appreciate any insights or advice on what to look out for and if there are any potential red flags I should be aware of. Thanks in advance!"
Seeking advice on my rights as a leaseholder after my flat was flooded with sewage water,_dp_singh,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/124l0pr/seeking_advice_on_my_rights_as_a_leaseholder/,"Hello everyone,

I'm in need of some advice regarding my brand new leasehold flat in Bristol, UK. I returned from a two-month vacation to find that my flat had been flooded with sewage water due to a blockage in the pipes. This has caused extensive damage to my belongings and the property itself.

I have been trying to contact my insurance provider and management company for the past four days to request temporary accommodation, but I have yet to receive a response. I pay for the management company, which pays for the building insurance.

Since the flat is just three months old, I was not aware of any issues with sewage water leakage. The water came out of the toilet and shower inlets.

I am unsure about my rights in this situation and would greatly appreciate any advice. Is there a way to obtain temporary accommodation from my insurance provider or management company? Additionally, as a new owner of the flat, what are my options for seeking compensation for the damages caused by the sewage water?

Thank you in advance for your help and suggestions.  


Update:  
\- My flat is a 1 Bedroom flat.  
\- I have got hold of the management company for buildings insurance.  
\- Sent an email to the insurance company requesting temporary accommodation and a claim for furniture and other belonging.

Our solicitor has stated that because of the state of the chimneys, the insurance is invalid which would obviously be a disaster and would mean that we would lose our mortgage (as well as not being insured). 

We asked the sellers if they would be willing to get the works done before exchange, on the grounds that we couldn’t possibly exchange on a property that has invalid insurance.

The sellers have also offered to reduce the price to compensate us for having to have the works done.

"Insurance company has lied to me I think, need advice",burner7191,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1e2m6xh/insurance_company_has_lied_to_me_i_think_need/,"
Over 8 years ago we put in an insurance claim for subsidence with our building insurance company. There were major delays and company mistakes on their part in every step and over the 8 years, the subsidence has got very bad and caused a range of other issues. My dad is the policy holder, but in that time, has developed dementia and is now in the late stages of it and is not working any more.

We moved to alternative accommodation in the November 2023 as they were ready to do the works, which they said would take 6 months. We got a tenancy for 1 year with a break clause, but the tenancy is under our names.

In this time, the council have deemed our house with the subsidence inhabitable due to the subsidence and have put in a prohibition order as it is structurally unsafe now.

It has been 8 months and the insurance company have not done anything except a site visit (they did many over the years, where they would come, take some photos and leave). They did this while we were in the property and that is all they have done since they vacated. They are saying there is a delay in the report coming back, which was done in April as they were not available between when we moved in and then.

The landlord emailed us to say there hadn’t been a rent payment for the next month sent yet and they believed the tenancy to be ending - I called the insurance company who wrote to me saying they had authorised an extension.

The landlord, about a month from this, said still nothing has been set up. Following that, I called the insurance company who said we have reached our limit for how much they will pay for alternative accommodation. We never knew there was a limit, and their delays have cost us to run this up. They are now saying we are liable for rent at the alternative accommodation, which is not something we have prepared for, nor that we believe is fair, as they said they were ready to start works almost a year ago which they haven’t. Furthermore, they lied about authorising an extension and had no plans of telling us it hadn’t actually been authorised.

Please can someone advise me on what to do next? I have filed a complaint to the insurance company but I am very stressed about the whole thing

FTB here attempting to buy with my partner in London. Have done lots of research but some things are probably only really gained by experience!

We are interested in buying a share of freehold flat in a building comprised of majority share of freehold flats, and some commercial units on the bottom. It's in a lovely area, the flat itself is spacious, quiet, and has a balcony. There is bike storage and some modest communal gardens. It would work well for us. It's been on the market since December. 

I wonder if experienced people have advice about service charge, which this year came out to 1750, covering cleaning and electricity in communal areas, gardening, roof and gutter, drains, building insurance, management fees (20% of total cost goes here), and accountant services. Is this reasonable? What questions should we be asking about this? 

Unfortunately with our budget and location requirements (due to my work) we cannot afford a freehold house. Your help is much appreciated!

"My flat is un-mortgageable, unsellable and will likely be uninhabitable soon due to a decade long subsidence issue that the property management company has no motivation to deal with. ",KRSCR,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhtf39/my_flat_is_unmortgageable_unsellable_and_will/,"I have a small flat that is leasehold property in a block of purpose built apartments in Wales, which I purchased 17 years ago. Throughout that time there has been subsidence affecting myself and a few of my neighbours, with signs both inside and outside our properties. 

When purchasing the property, I had a survey done that noted “signs of historic movement, likely not active”. At that time it was some very small cracking on an external wall that had been refilled with some cement (repointed) some years prior. It still passed the survey for mortgage purposes but as the years have gone on the damage has been apparent in other parts of the building and as such I am no longer able to get a new mortgage or remortgage my own. 

Three separate mortgage application surveyors I’ve had when applying for new products say that they will not give any lending in the current condition and as it was mentioned on my original survey I have no recourse through my original surveyor. 

Over the last decade, I have attempted to resolve the matter through the property’s management company. The freehold is owned by the residents (so I have a 1/28th share of this company) but they employ a property management company to deal with all issues. My efforts in trying to deal with the issue get me nowhere. 

Originally a claim was made on the building’s insurance policy. This was declined as they stated that signs of subsidence (even if historic) were apparent prior to the policy taken out. Apparently there had been a change of insurance provider at some point. The management company then brought in their own surveyor who monitored the movement for over a year and stated the movement had stopped. The management company then appealed the building insurance’s decision, which again failed, then went to the ombudsman. Last month they deemed to much time had elapsed since the original claim and as it was over 6 years ago nothing could be done. I feel the management company have done a poor job in this process to ensure the issue was rectified by insurance. 

Throughout this time I have asked the management company what would be their plan of action if the subsidence could not be covered under insurance. They seem out of their depth with what would need to take place and state the resident’s company that they are employed by have little enthusiasm to rectify the problem or raise service charges to fund remedial work. They are mostly elderly residents who fail to see an urgency or motivation to get it sorted. I feel they are likely not upholding their legal responsibilities in getting addressing the issue. 

Movement still seems active in the property itself. The management company has periodically covered the cost of contractors to patch up internal cracking but it still continues to affect residents. They wish to just continue with this course of action, as it shows they are doing something about it but not actually addressing the cause of the issue. There is now a six inch incline from one side of my flat to the other which is very noticeable. My property is un-mortgageable, unsellable and I fear at some point will become uninhabitable due to safety concerns. 

I have told the management company they have a legal duty to rectify the situation, although I am unsure what I should be doing to ensure this is taken seriously. 

I’d be grateful for any help or advice please. Thanks.

I was offered a 7-year old flat in a building with cladding issues. It's mortgageable (got 4.51%) as the cladding works have been scheduled and paid for fully. We would get it ~20k below market price (compared to what it would be without the cladding). 
Now the service charge is 3200-3500£ per year, building insurance (because of the cladding) is 1300£ per year and the ground rent will soon rise to 450£. The flat comes with a car park which is 700£ per year in maintenance. All in all a good 5-6k in service charge/ insurance/ extra cost in addition to the mortgage. 

The building is in a great, central location (London) and we would be very happy there. Minimal moving costs.

Really put off buying flat in SE - are my reasons fair?,bluewaves1234,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/160iu0r/really_put_off_buying_flat_in_se_are_my_reasons/,"Considering buying a flat in South East, but really put off due to following reasons:

* Don't like idea of leasehold over freehold. Leasehold seems to have very high service charges like £3k+ in South East and then ground rent as well. Feels like wasted money every month. I get would be maintenance costs with house, but £3k a year for say a small 2 bed seems too high.
* Further to this, I worry about not only the service charges, but also the whole power imbalance with the leaseholder relationship. For instance, you hear bad stories about remedial works needing to be done, so worry about buying a flat and then suddenly need to pay £15k to contribute to roof being fixed.
* Given you don't also don't have any input into these works or even service charge breakdown, feel costs are exorbitant and a bit of a rip off. For instance, can't choose builder so firm who owns the lease can choose really expensive builder and any remedial works are extortionate. I've heard stories of similar with building insurance, where firm owning the lease can choose ridiculously expensive building insurance and then get commissions back from the insurer.
* Any new build flats especially high rises seem to be ridiculously hot and built with silly amounts of insulation - great for energy bills, but roasting hot in the summer, especially with summers gradually getting hotter and hotter each year in south east.

I think biggest worry is regarding capital appreciation compared to houses/freeholds:

* There seems to be tonnes and tonnes of new build flats in the south east. Further to this, with lots of empty office buildings, will likely be tonnes and tonnes of new build flats being churned out year after year, making capital appreciation difficult purely due to supply and demand. There is also lots and lots of selling of b2l properties in the South East which are mainly flats due to being unprofitable investment with interest rates, so this puts further donwards pressure on prices at least in short to medium term.
* Other issues like cladding and general undesirability of flats given wfh and leaseholds being very unpopular mean demand not that high
* Compare that with houses and due to green belt and planning rules, literally no new supply whatsoever in London or commuter belt, like you go on Rightmove and search for new build detached houses inside the M25 and there are about 10 results.

As a result, in summary worry about buying a flat, getting ripped off with service charges and maybe extortionate repair works that need to be done. Then when come to sell, due to tonnes of new supply coming onto the market and demand not that high, so end up making a loss or at best breaking even.

Do people think this reasoning is sound and therefore should really try and wait maybe a couple of years when can then stretch budget and afford a decent freehold house with none of the issues with flats as detailed above?

I recently purchased a ground floor flat in London, completing the third purchase in the house from the same landlord. The Landlord has now issued a section 5 (meaning we can buy the freehold for 10k combined, as they have found a suitable company that would buy the freehold otherwise). The problem is that our house as had subsidence caused by a tree, which was cut down, but we have a crack in the wall which has been partially remediated). The current landlord has put in a claim to our insurer. Unfortunately, it seems like we need to get new building insurance once we purchase the freehold (I think this would be the case even  if another management company would buy it instead). Therefore, if we wanted to renew our insurance, they came back to us to say they would not cover the subsidence ...

This is all very frustrating and I wonder if legal at all, that we get shut out of building insurance because the landlord wants to sell the freehold.

In addition, to complicate things, we are planning to extend the house, which was originally the idea to help fix the subsidence (i.e. there will be new foundations and structural support which will stabilise the structure). So we thought the insurers would be receptive to us providing remediation work, but I am still unclear if they will cover us while we do the works.

Is there any help/options I can get that I have missed ?

New Freeholder - Management Fee Query,dandaman62,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/16mp0x8/new_freeholder_management_fee_query/,"Hi All,

Based in England.
Hopefully someone can help!

I live in a small flat that is a leasehold property with the rest of the building (just two flats) and pay a mortgage.

My previous freeholder recently retired and auctioned off the freehold to a new company. Today, the new freeholders contacted me and sent me several invoices - two for my yearly ground rent and building insurance (all fine) but also an invoice for a 'management fee' (more expensive than the ground rent!). The latter is something I've never had to pay before with my previous freeholder, who only charged the ground rent and insurance.

I am a bit ignorant on these matters and have not heard of a management fee before, and am unsure what it is or what it's for. They do not explain in the invoice or letter they sent me. I tried to research online but I'm getting mixed answers so was hoping to get some help here!

Is a management fee something normal? Are they allowed to add this charge on top of my other due payments?

Thanks is advance, all!"
