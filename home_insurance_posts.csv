I'm shopping around home+content insurance for 4br house and the quotes I get is around 600-700. Meanwhile, google says that average home insurance this size is about 250. what am I missing here? the only reasons I can think of is because I mark all keys as non standard (as I don't know the key types, yet to complete) and that a big portion of the property has flat roof (loft, reae extension), but I wouldn't imagine that will shoot up the price this much. or is this a reasonable range?"
Home insurance,JennyW93,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1do45fm/home_insurance/,"I’m buying a dormer bungalow worth £200k. My mortgage broker put me in touch with a buildings insurance broker who has found me two quotes: one is £650/year (no accidental damage cover), the other is £900 (with accidental damage). 

Both are for buildings cover of £1M and contents of £75k. 

Am I going mad, or is that… a huge amount? When I went on one of those insurance comparison sites, it reckoned the entire house would only cost about £185k (edit: it was actually £197k, but still… not £1M) to rebuild. My contents don’t amount to anywhere near £75k, maybe more like £20k at a push. 

The only major caveat is that the property is in a high risk river flood zone (it was built in 1970s and has not flooded yet, the flood risk stems from a nearby stream - it’s not a river by any stretch, but it is a girthy stream). 

The mortgage lender has specifically said I need insurance with flood protection, so I’m not sure if that’s what’s making this broker’s quotes so high, but when I plugged everything into a comparison website I was getting quotes for more like £250/£300 for the year.

FTB - Home Insurance,nano-moose,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1b7wpkr/ftb_home_insurance/,"Hi there,

I'm at a point where I need to take out buildings insurance to exchange contracts. I have two questions:

1) Is it worth taking out buildings and contents with the same provider? My completion date is almost 2 months away, and one of the providers I called said their policy would only allow up to 30 days between start of buildings insurance and start of contents insurance. So I'm thinking I'll probably need to take the two out separately. Anyone been in a similar position?

2) I'm seeing quotes of £360-400+ for a 3 bed detached with garage for buildings + contents. I've searched on loads of comparison sites. This seems quite a lot relative to what I've heard other people are paying, but I have also been told prices are going up. Does this seem reasonable?

Buildings insurance- property owner or home insurance policy?,sparklemoon135,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bk6jyg/buildings_insurance_property_owner_or_home/,"I live in a Victorian terraced property split into two flats.

We are trying to arrange buildings insurance, and have been offered a property owner policy which is expensive and seems tailored to landlords. From my research I cannot seem to find out why we need a property owner policy rather than just a home insurance policy, even though the broker believes we do. I have found an alternative much cheaper home insurance quote from Privilege which does seem to account for the fact that we have two flats in one building- but I am nervous to go against the broker advice because I have not dealt with buildings insurance before. Does anyone know whether we’d need a property owner or home insurance policy? The broker was struggling to explain why. Thanks!

Arranging Home Insurance before Exchange,MomoSkywalker,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1aq4z8n/arranging_home_insurance_before_exchange/,"Hi All, 

FTB and we are at the stage where most things has been done, just waiting for some last seller enquires. I know, part of the mortgage stipulation, we need to arrange home insurance and it needs to go on risk before exchange. 

&#x200B;

Now the issue is, when you do it on comparison sits like [moneysupermarket.com](https://moneysupermarket.com), it assumes you already have the house so asks when you purchased it when I haven't. Also askes questions that I am not sure of. I have emailed the Point of contact at the EA, she has been very helpful getting us info, she has emailed the sellers the questions we asked, like types of lock, how many smoak alarm ect.

&#x200B;

Just based on this, it feels like I will have to search for a quote and literally do the home insurance as soon as I exchange, is there anyway I can do it now, get it ready and then ask them to do it on exchange when I call up or once I have a date. I know if you look at insurance early, the price will always be cheaper if you get the quote 30 days before you want to start so it feels we can't take advantage of cheaper quotes. 

&#x200B;

Another thing, we will not move into the property straight away, it will be vacant for about a month as we want to fix it up before we do so, is that allowed on home insurance?

&#x200B;

Any advise please on how to go about setting up home insurance on a property you don't own yet, what did you do? Thank you in advance. "

Both with £250 excess, the comprehensive also includes:

- accidental damage (buildings)

-Accidental damage (contents)

-Home emergency cover (eg being locked out, failure of electrics/heating with no excess, up to £1k)

Home insurance for subsidence of a Conservatory,DarthReputation,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1deadxn/home_insurance_for_subsidence_of_a_conservatory/,"We're looking at purchasing a property built circa 1980 and we recently got back a Level 2 Homebuyer Report survey report that mentions subsidence in a conservatory attached to the property. The conservatory was installed in 1999. There's no evidence of subsidence in the main property, just between the main property and the conservatory, there is a noticeable crack.

If/when we move in, our plan is to tear down the conservatory within a year.

We're concerned how this is going to affect home insurance. Could we still proceed through the online process on comparison sites/specific insurers websites, or should we call insurers to explain the situation and get a custom quote?  
  
Some online sites have a question on subsidence, but they generally don't ask specific questions about it. We want to establish that it is not the main property affected and the source of it is going to hopefully disappear within a year. Would we answer yes to this kind of question?  
  
Generally we're trying to get an idea of how likely it is we'll get insurance at a reasonable price.

Our mortgage broker suggested a home insurance company to us and doing some online comparison they came out at a similar or slightly lower price than what we could find so we went with them. 

We renewed for year 2,  I think the rate changed barely at all and we added the ability to have a smart lock so we figured it might. 

Now, approaching start of year 3, and our quote is a big increase (40%? I’d have to check again, but it was several hundred). We have never made a claim but there were some garage break-ins (for bikes) on our estate. We don’t own a car so we can’t bundle car insurance. We both have life insurance but those policies are with other providers. We’re in SE England.

Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,Mexijim,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bdqgdu/anybody_ever_claimed_on_home_insurance_for_an/,"Long story short, I’ve had a leak on the party wall of a terraced house for a few months. Checked my policy when I noticed it, said it excludes issues due to natural aging / decline of roofs, so had some remedial repairs carried out with my own gutters / flashing / etc.

Fast forward to last week, damp issue still ongoing. I finally convinced my next door neighbour to let me check his house inside and out. It’s in a huge state of disrepair - gutters hanging off, render blown, obvious leak from his roof, coming across into my property from his soaked bedroom wall.

Neighbour is refusing to carry out repairs, even refused to let me organise a roofer to come out and give an objective opinion. Says he’s too skint to do anything (guy is outright homeowner, and not financially poor).

I don’t have legal cover on my policy sadly (assumed I did, added it recently but wont cover this pre-existing issue anyway). I have a policy with LV, never contacted them in 6 years of living here. I’m currently getting legal advice from various places, including my employers union. Excess is £600 with LV.

If I contact my insurer, what should I expect them to say? Seen various replies ranging from they wont get involved unless I pay my £600 excess first, to them sending out an assessor first to see what’s going on. I’m apprehensive to contact them as I know it’s opening a can of worms and will possibly ruin my premiums for years to come even if they do nothing.

Any advice greatly appreciated.

Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,PurpleRainOnTPlain,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1dazrkj/question_about_having_home_insurance_between/,"Hello,

I am due to exchange on a flat on Monday and would then have 1-2 weeks between exchange and completion. I have read that it's important to ensure you have home insurance from the point of exchange as by that point you are legally responsible for the property. But I'm a bit confused about what ""home insurance"" means.

It is a leasehold flat so the property has building insurance, paid for as part of the service charge. It is a requirement of my mortgage that the property has building insurance, so the fact my solicitor has not explicitly told me to take out insurance must mean they are satisfied that this would meet the mortgage requirements, right?

Is the above advice only referring to building insurance, or will I i also need to take out contents insurance from the exchange date onwards? What happens if for instance, during the gap between exchange and completion, there is a leak and that ruins the carpet? Or the boiler breaks?

I viewed the flat for a 'final' time 2 weeks ago as I was told we would be exchanging the following day, however a last minute issue in the chain delayed things. Everything seemed fine on that viewing, however I live a considerable distance away and it's not really feasible to do another viewing before Monday. If, on completion, it transpires that there are issues which weren't present when I last viewed it (for instance if the boiler were to break), how does this all play out and would it differ if the issue occurred before exchange versus after exchange and who has the onus of proof upon them?

I don't have any specific reasons to be concerned, but have read horror stories and so  am just feeling very unsure about this brief period where I am legally responsible for the property, but don't actually live there and have no control over things.

Is it sufficient for me to ask a local estate agent to provide a valuation or should I get a resedential surveyor to provide me the numbers?

We'll be soon in the process of selling our house and moving to another but was thinking about Home insurance. We have insurance on our current house that we bought on exchange  back when we bought.

How does it work when requiring insurance at exchange on the new house?

Or swap over address on current policy to new address but our current home won't be covered?

We just bought a leasehold property. It seems that there had been a claim on the home insurance back in 2015, due to subsidence caused by a tree which was located in the freeholder's garden. As new owners we have now been asked to pay £900 premium for the year.   
This feels unfair as we just became owners of this property and also the damage to the property was caused by a tree in the freeholder's  property.

Unintentional error resulting in home insurance cancellation.,Negative_Mortgage727,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/17410o9/unintentional_error_resulting_in_home_insurance/,"Advice needed, unintentional error resulting in policy cancellation

Hi,

Hoping for some advice. Apologies if this is outside of the scope of the group.

I’m based in the UK and bought a house at the beginning of August which is when the buildings and contents insurance started.

My family and I were expecting to move straight in but unfortunately we ended up having to get the place rewired, plastered throughout and on and on.  There have been unforeseen delays throughout the process.

We’re having it re-roofed on 23/10 and I thought it would be prudent to inform the insurance company of the work that would be commencing. I did this tonight via live chat.

During this conversation I was asked if my family and I were occupying the property and I said “not yet, as we’re still getting work done and decorating”.

The live chat agent then told me they would have to cancel the policy, as when the policy was taken out we stated that it would be occupied.

I informed them that I had been staying overnight in the property a couple of nights a week, but at this point the damage was done and they now want me to call to process the cancellation.

This insurance was arranged via an agent who I will be calling in the morning to seek advice from but obviously I am now concerned about the ramifications this may have on the mortgage and future home insurance.

It may be worth mentioning that we’re staying at my parents house which is 5 minutes away and that someone has been present at the property every day since the completion date. 

I’m hoping that it will be clear that this was all a misunderstanding and there’s a way to navigate out of this mess that doesn’t jeopardise the mortgage. Just wondering if anyone has had experience with this scenario before.

Cheers!"

"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",FinalRecording3233,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ap38nq/landlord_has_no_home_insurance_leak_unknown_to_me/,"Hello all,

I’m at a bit of a loss what to do and seeking advice. I bought a leasehold flat 6 months ago. Last Wednesday I got an email while at work from my building management company which said a leak has been reported from my flat which has caused the ceiling to cave in on the flat below and gave me the contact details of the tenant in the flat. I immediately left work and contacted the tenant, I live a 5 minute walk away from work so arrived to the damaged flat within minutes. The tenant was aware of the leak for a few days, his ceiling fan started dripping whenever I was showering and the day before the ceiling caved his light fixture completely filled with water. I’m unsure why I wasn’t made aware of this until the ceiling fell through.

This is the first property I’ve owned and not experienced this before so I did just assume as this was from my flat I was liable for the damage so after stopping the water in my flat, I got the balling rolling with contacting my personal home insurance to fix the flat below. They advised me that actually the landlord of the flat below should be claiming off her own insurance to fix the damage. I contacted the landlord who was understandably not happy, and I advised her what I had been told from my insurance. She claimed she should not being doing that as it’s my fault the flat is damaged. 

She then contacted the management company who agreed with her, so I contacted the management company myself to confirm if this was the case. They said yes I’m liable for the damage out of pocket. To confirm, I was completely unaware of this leak. I asked the management company what do I pay personal insurance and a service charge for if I’m not even covered in these circumstances. I was then told I could see if the building insurance would cover it so they gave me the insurer details.

I contacted the insurer and they told me based on the information gave I have nothing to worry about, and once again advised that the landlord should be using her landlord home insurance to get the tenant support as soon as possible, and then can mitigate her losses through the building insurance. I informed the landlord of this right away. She was refusing to use her insurance but said she will arrange a builder to come to the flat. 

I arranged a plumber to come out to my flat (so the problem was fixed within 24 hours of it being reported to me), who confirmed a faulty waste pipe under my bath. I updated the landlord of this at 2pm the following day and then she asked if I wanted to arrange my own contractor to sort the damage in her flat, or her arrange her own and bill me the money. As this was the following day I’d been reading online that it’s the landlords responsibility and as I didn’t intentionally cause a leak (like overflowing the bath or leaving taps on), I’m not fully liable. I again informed her that two insurance companies have advised me the correct way to manage this is to use her insurance and told her I’d already opened up a claim with the building insurance. I gave her the insurance details and didn’t hear anything more from her. On Friday (the following day after my last conversation with the landlord), the tenant informed me builders have arrived to fix his ceiling. So it took two full days for the landlord to arrange fixing damage to her flat.

Today she has contacted me to ask if I’d contacted the freeholder to open a claim. This completely confused me as I’m not sure why I’d be contacting the owner of building? She then told me she has not contacted the building insurance and I’ve just found out the landlord doesn’t have home insurance for the flat at all.

The damages are £800 so far. If she doesn’t have home insurance, what are the options here? Will the building insurance pay out directly to her if I’m covered? I understand a leak came from my flat, but as mentioned it wasn’t from my nuisance or negligence. This is really stressing me out (as I’m sure it is for the landlord) but dealing with a landlord that doesn’t seem to be aware of their responsibilities as a landlord is causing even more stress .

Have I misunderstood my duties here and I’m actually in the wrong? Should I be paying the £800 out of goodwill, or wait for the building insurance outcome? Any advice at all on how to proceed would be appreciated."
Do you pay for home insurance Extras like legal cover or accidental damage cover?,Ok_Pumpkin9588,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/185ti2x/do_you_pay_for_home_insurance_extras_like_legal/,"FTB here approaching exchange and trying to decide on the level of cover for the building and contents insurance. A bit unsure whether it’s worth going for things like legal cover or accidental damaged to buildings or contents. Is it commonplace to buy these extras with insurance? (I’m looking at More Than but I’m assuming all providers offer these extras)

  
An additional question I have is about the Level 3 buildings survey I had done as part of the purchase. If I was to claim on my home insurance later, would the insurer ask me to disclose the survey report? Nothing completely terrible came up in the survey but there were the usual things for a Victorian terrace like damp resulting from poor ventilation and cement pointing, electric/gas/drainage surveys recommended, windows and gutters need replacing soon, some fairly minor roof repairs needed (I’m planning to get the gutters and roof stuff done soon after moving in).

  
I’m just wondering if the fact that a number of fairly minor issues were flagged in the buildings survey would just give the insurer an excuse to decline any claim by saying that the house wasn’t in great state of repair anyway. So the cynic in me thinks that it might be best to get the minimum level of cover since the insurer would just find an excuse not to pay up if something happened.

  
But I have no first hand experience of buildings insurance, hence wondering what kind of products other people here for go for.

Flat roof inspection for home insurance,xiaoipower,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/11t4s6p/flat_roof_inspection_for_home_insurance/,"Hi all, we live in a mid-terrace town house with a flat roof. In my home insurance policy I noticed the following clause:

""We will not cover you for loss or damage to your buildings and contents if damage is due to the flat roof not being in a good state of repair, unless the flat roof has been inspected by a qualified person in the last five years and any necessary repairs carried out immediately.""

I'm a bit lost as to who you even ask to do this, some thoughts I had:

1) Go with a conveyance company - seem the most 'legally robust' but then if they did actually spot any issues I would still need to get a roofing contractor to fix it. Also it seems like a bit overkill.

2) Roofing company - not sure if they can produce a report with the right 'legal' format / evidence trail that the insurance company would be happy with.

Landlord selling the freehold to us kicks us out of home insurance,Lopsided-Let-5995,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/15hwjdt/landlord_selling_the_freehold_to_us_kicks_us_out/,"Hey guys, just wanted to look for some help on this sub. I recently purchased a ground floor flat in London, completing the third purchase in the house from the same landlord. The Landlord has now issued a section 5 (meaning we can buy the freehold for 10k combined, as they have found a suitable company that would buy the freehold otherwise). The problem is that our house as had subsidence caused by a tree, which was cut down, but we have a crack in the wall which has been partially remediated). The current landlord has put in a claim to our insurer. Unfortunately, it seems like we need to get new building insurance once we purchase the freehold (I think this would be the case even  if another management company would buy it instead). Therefore, if we wanted to renew our insurance, they came back to us to say they would not cover the subsidence ...

This is all very frustrating and I wonder if legal at all, that we get shut out of building insurance because the landlord wants to sell the freehold.

In addition, to complicate things, we are planning to extend the house, which was originally the idea to help fix the subsidence (i.e. there will be new foundations and structural support which will stabilise the structure). So we thought the insurers would be receptive to us providing remediation work, but I am still unclear if they will cover us while we do the works.

Is there any help/options I can get that I have missed ?

Home insurance issue post building survey,serennow,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/uwmdxl/home_insurance_issue_post_building_survey/,"We're in the process of trying to buy a 1930s property. One of the issues flagged on the building survey was the roof - we already knew it was old and will have a limited ""shelf-life"". However the surveyor flagged that the way it was made (I think with no covering under the slate) may make insurance problematic.

So, we contacted several of the major home insurance companies. There seems to be no problem with the roof so we went ahead to get quotes and two of them came back saying the property was not insurable due to something in the local area.

Got my keys to my first house just before Xmas. House is one of these do-uppers where everything inside pretty much needs updating, new kitchen, new bathroom, potential rewiring, painting.

So I told the insurance company I'm not living there whilst all this is taking place. They give you 60 days unoccupied cover anyway. 60 days are almost up, and things are taking longer than anticipated. Still need to get a new bathroom and kitchen and decorating. I just rang the insurance company to let them know of this, and to extend my unoccupancy by another few months.

However as soon as I mentioned new kitchen and new bathroom, she classed it as internal works. Then started asking questions such as 'Is it a single story or double story extension?'. I said no building works, merely getting a new bathroom and new kitchen. Apparently they class that as internal work and thus more risk to things going wrong.

They said they could extend my unoccupancy but charge 50% of my initial premium for the internal works.

Not sure if I can mention said insurance company here. Surely people renovate their bathrooms and kitchens all the time?

Home Insurance and Rebuild Cost - Do I understand?,Stringsandattractors,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/oxyyto/home_insurance_and_rebuild_cost_do_i_understand/,"Hi all

I think I’ve been mistaken about home insurance for a while.

When looking on price comparison sites I specify a rebuild cost. In the results, it says building coverage is a million - or close - next to most policies.

I’ve just renewed my insurance (got a couple of weeks grace ofc) and I’m told the building is insured up to the rebuild cost. Of course this makes total logical sense.. but then where does the million come from in those results? Is that just the MAXIMUM they could insure? Ie if your house was worth 3 mil, you would have to look elsewhere? Or are they actually insuring everyone for up to a million in rebuild costs?

I know I'm totally overthinking this and worrying about what's the worst that could happen and after a phonecall I got from another insurance company looking to sell me on their service (at around £320, £61 on top for emergency cover) which is quite expensive compared to my own research its got me overthinking this

one worry is the boiler/heating system or electric not working or breaking down in the first year will insurance cover this they all seem to use different terms to cover different packages, I've seen the term ""emergency breakdown cover"" which usually has to be added as a bonus at about £61 extra for the year will ease that worry, finding the cheapest is around 80 for the year (with a £500 excess of course) from Aviva and they are covering quite a lot which was quite surprising,

but (and here's where I'm overthinking) with Aviva they are don't have an option to cover breakage to windows and covering underground damage to pipes, from an early memory from a family home I remember something about its the home owners responsibility to maintain plumbing/gas/electric wires under your garden until it reaches the street

I have a front garden which is 100% owned to my property, does the gas mains pipes fall under my responsibility for maintenance until the pipes reach the end of my garden and then the council/gas company maintain it from the street access from there, does insurance cover this and what is that term/package called.  some companies seem to use different terms that seem to cover the same package or don't offer it at all

&#x200B;

I know the cost of roof damage would be shared since we both benefit, but since the garden is entirely owned by me would only I would have the responsibility of repairing the pluming/gas/electricity under the garden if such an event of damage or wear n tear or blockage would occur

I am mostly on the roads, travelling for work purposes and will be barely home, perhaps a few days in a month.

I am aware that taking in them as lodgers would have the following financial implications on my end:

1. I would lose the 25% discount on the council tax for a single occupant

2. Home insurance premium will go up 

3. Utility bills will go up, but they are happy for a 50/50 split

I am currently looking at flats in my area. A really nice one that ticks every box has come up for £160k (I’m down south).

Salary: £30k, take home after student loans, pension etc about £1,850 a month. 

Deposit: £25k

Mortgage: £30k x 4.5 = £135k. 

Ideally I would make an offer and get it for less, but let’s say the flat goes for £160k.

This is what I estimate I’ll be paying, monthly:

Mortgage: £750ish.

Service charge: £92

Council tax: £85

Water: £10?

Electricity: £60?

Phone: £25

Wi-Fi/broadband: £30

Home insurance: £15?

No gas, no ground rent, no TV licence. 

So I’ll have around £780ish left a month for food shopping, savings, leisure and annual charges such as car insurance etc.

We are buying a property in England. During the conveyancing process, our solicitor found out that the windows, which were changed last year - neither has a building regulation approval nor a warranty.

We had Level 3 survey done on 8th of March, it came back clean, with no signs of damp or water damage.

Has anyone here had such an experience, and how did you solve it? Did you go after the seller, building surveyor or were you successful at claiming with your home insurance?

I fear that I know the answer - buyer beware, but am hoping someone can prove me wrong?

fwiw, our solicitor recommended to go after the seller via small claims court or asking them to claim via their previous insurance. Building surveyor came out again, and as expected said ""we don't move furniture, sry"". Our home insurance said, ""sry, preexisting condition"".

Is buying better than renting?,Curious_Abies_1288,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1790zce/is_buying_better_than_renting/,"Going to be a controversial subject here but I've been running the numbers and I can't seem to make buying a house be more financially responsible than renting (for now)

For this example I am only referring to rent/mortgage and upkeep as council tax and bills etc are variable regardless.

Current situation: 2.5 bed semi detatched nice area large garden and double drive 2009 build house

Current rent: £480pcm

Maintenance: negligible, minor repairs undertaken by me. Anything major including bathroom/kitchen upgrades completed by landlord every 10-15 years.

Potential situation: similar house, similar area

Mortgage :658 pcm over 30 years

Maintenance: 350 per month (3% of property value per year going by online statistics) obviously this isn't every month and is averaged out to account for upgrades and maintenance.

Now I know ""rent is wasted money"" but hear me out. Around £300 of that mortgage is interest. 

Plus your maintenance costs which something may require done at short notice and could be a large financial hit and we may not be able to afford.

So by renting in real terms I'm saving £170 of the interest and maintenance costs. 

Which leaves me around £360 per month that would be going to the capital of the house. 

Now if I put this into my pension my employer would match and then some. 

If I take my private pension lump sum in 30 years (the same time the mortgage would be up) I would get £125k in todays money which would almost be enough to cover the cost of the house. I could take out a 5 year mortgage for the remainder.

In this scenario I have no worries about major maintenance, upgrades or any damage that may occur. Obviously I would have home insurance but there is still the stress of organising things to be repaired and going through insurance companies.

And I'll expect the usual rent keeps going up comment but it is a housing association which is limited to rent increases of around 3% per year.

Is renting actually more financially suitable in this scenario?

How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,Alternative-Goose774,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1e0hgei/how_screwed_is_the_seller_after_my_discovery/,"
I’m really curious how this situation will unfold for the sellers of a house I was going to buy. 

I found this grand 4 bedroom, 3 story detached Edwardian house for sale in the perfect location and made an offer. It was accepted so I arranged a level 3 survey given the house is over 120 years old. 

The surveyor told me that the house is without a doubt suffering from ongoing and progressive subsidence and ground movement. The drains are completely blocked which could be the cause but only a structural engineer and various specialists could confirm this. 

The seller, who only brought the house 3 years ago, seems to be completely unaware of this. I was told they didn’t do a survey other than the mortgage providers basic valuation which is completely insane given the size and age of the property. 

Looking back at Rightmove photos from 2021 it looks like the house was subsiding back then when the current owners bought it. In the TA6 or TA10 form (can’t remember which one) they state that they have home insurance, haven’t made any claims and haven’t been subject to any large increases in premiums. 

So I’m wondering, if they make a claim to their insurers, will they honour the claim if the subsidence started prior to when the current owners purchased the house? If the subsidence occurred whilst they were living there (very unlikely I think), would they face any issues given they didn’t do a survey prior to purchasing in 2021 meaning they would’ve discovered subsidence before purchasing?

I’ve been told the amount of money it would take to fix the problem and underpin the house would be unthinkable especially as the part of the house where the subsidence is is built on shallow grounds.

I’m feeling super relieved to have pulled out of the sale but also quite concerned for the seller given the money, time and stress all this will involve. "

-A letter from the mortgage lender confirming they will: Allow you to sublet your entire home and not change the repayment mortgage to a buy to let mortgage.

-A letter from your building or contents insurer saying that they will allow you to sublet your home.

-Evidence of the personal circumstances on which you are basing your application, for example – proof you have lost your job.

-If your property is affected by unsafe cladding, you will also need to send one of the following: An EWS1 form with a rating of A3 or B2, or evidence this form is not available from your freeholder or management company OR evidence supplied by your freeholder or management company that your property is affected by unsafe cladding.

-There is a £50 admin fee (£75 if there's a developer on the account)

"Level 3 survey says the roof is in good condition, this year the rafters snap!",poshbakerloo,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1d37xnv/level_3_survey_says_the_roof_is_in_good_condition/,"I've put a claim into my home insurance but I have a terrible feeling they'll say it's 'gradual damage' and not cover it. The only thing I'm clinging to is that I only bought my house 12 months ago and the level 3 survey comments specifically on the woodwork of the roof being in a good condition - this week I noticed two rafters have snapped and need replacing which will cost £1000s 😭

I do actually think it may have been caused by some high winds and extremely heavy rain we had recently as nothing has fallen on the roof, but it's not like I heard the snap and can pin it down to a date, I just stumbled across it. 

Has anyone successfully claimed on insurance for something like this?"
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ay0zff/is_the_freehold_price_offered_by_our_landlord_on/,"We bought a leasehold house for £460,000 in 2021. The lease began in 1893 and has 1869 years left on it now. The ground rent is £12 a year (though I note that the landlord refers to its extortionate insurance charge as ‘insurance rent’ on the insurance invoice). I asked to buy the freehold and was quoted in August 23 ‘a consideration of £8000 plus their survey fee £350+vat and legal fees £1,140+ vat’. I’ve tried online calculation tools and they come back with a £0 freehold valuation. 

I’m a bit (a lot ;p) overwhelmed by the information available, and I’m not sure which valuation basis we’d use to calculate our freehold value (original or special valuation basis) let alone how I can manually calculate it!?!

Our neighbour (who bought his freehold at a much lower price) was shocked at the price and advised that we should have served a notice instead of the polite request. He advised that we could let the 3 month offer from our landlord expire and then serve a notice. 

We have a very limited budget and we are now wondering whether it is prudent to employ a chartered surveyor to independently value the freehold and take this figure to the landlord to negotiate? But the landlord could still refuse an independent valuation therefore negating our extra expense? 

The issue we have with being leasehold is the extortionate insurance the landlord charges us - £1225 last year for fire cover only. With the cost of living impact in general it’s a struggle to pay this effectively pointless insurance on top of our existing house and contents insurance. I queried the figure and they said it was based on our house being valued at 1.5 million (rebuild). I challenged this as home insurance companies typically advise that the rebuild value is less than the house market value, but they wouldn’t budge, despite being told we have existing insurance, and told us that if we don’t like it our option is to buy the freehold.

Any thoughts on the best way to proceed would be greatly appreciated. And whether the 8k is a reasonable or extortionate charge? Thanks in advance :)

"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",mangette94,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ebdsh0/landlord_renovating_bathroom_after_accidental/,"I'm sorry in advance for any grammar and spelling problems…

My husband and I have been privately renting a 3 bed 1 bath house for 7 years and have 1 year left on our contract. We've never met our landlord and have only dealt with the letting agent (who seems to be the real winner in this whole debacle).

So 2 months ago, I slipped and fell whilst showering, which resulted in me falling through the bathtub. Luckily, (aside from my pride) it was just the bath that was damaged. We immediately contacted the letting agent with pictures and apologies and offered to replace the bathtub ourselves. We had previously gone all out with our home insurance and luckily we were covered by them for the repairs. 

Our landlord however, requested that the letting agent send over their own contractor, who then told us that more work needed to be done to the bathroom than previously thought, quoting us a couple of grand. It is maybe worth mentioning now that we haven't received any invoice yet and won't until the work is done.

The letting agent then told us the landlord wanted to proceed with the contractor and that their own insurance would cover half and hopefully our insurance will cover the rest. We at no point actually agreed to anything, this was all decided for us. But we didn't press, our reasoning being that it's ultimately the landlord's home and if that is how he wants to do it, so be it.

So, 2 months later (yes, I’ve been washing in my sink for 2 months and yes, the landlord knew) the work finally started this week and contractor discovered some interesting decisions the previous owners (preceding landlord) had made, highlights being:

Instead of wall tiles with normal tile adhesive, floor tiles and cement was used. So the contractors were pulling off the wall with the tiles and leaving huge holes. Also the old bath was too big for the bathroom, so previous owners cut into the wall to make it fit. Both of these now resulting in all the walls needing to be rebuilt and replastered. The contractor is also installing new lights and is building a wall shelf.
So… what we thought was going to be a bath install and a bit of retiling has turned into a partial renovation and what should have been a few days work has been a week with no end in sight (so far the bath is in, but not usable and they have tiled one wall).

This is basically my very long winded way of asking, How much of this are we going to be expected to pay for? Chances are our insurance will only cover the bath and I don't know what we're going to do if we’re going to be asked to pay for something we had no say or control over. I think it's safe to say that it's all gone a bit out of control and I'm very scared of the invoice that's coming and just want to have a bath…

When is it appropriate to use trace and access insurance claim? ,seukexpat,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1drzg8t/when_is_it_appropriate_to_use_trace_and_access/,"We have guests staying with us for the first time after we moved into our house (~6 months ago) and using the guest bathroom (sink, walk in shower, toilet) that we never use otherwise. We since discovered the tile just inside the door and carpet just outside the door are getting quite damp underneath. 

We called a plumber out and he visually inspected the sink and toilet in the bathroom and concluded that as the pipes for those go straight down, they were likely not the cause of the dampness.

He then pulled up the shower drain and stated that he noticed two small areas where there was potential for leakage due to gaps in the caulking so he removed all the previous caulk and then re-caulked the entire drain basin.

I spent some time with a hair dryer on the tile edge / carpet to dry out as much as possible and then left a fan running for probably close to 36 hours which dried out the area to the extent that there was no dampness or ""squishiness"" in the tile.

We waited probably close to 4 days before our guests used that shower again. Initially there were no signs of dampness following the use, but about 24-36 hours after 4 showers in total, the dampness returned.

So at this point, our thinking is;
1) the leak is somewhere past the shower drain basin / under the floor
2) the leak is on the surface of the shower / bathroom floor itself and is needing resealing/grouting
3) the leak is actually from the the toilet or sink and it went unnoticed.

At this point in time, it's likely worth filing a leak trace and access claim with my home insurance as it will likely involve pulling up and restoring/replacing the tiles, but concerned about ""saying the wrong thing"" and having the claim denied for some reason.

Alternatively, is there anything else we can do to assess if this is going to be a 4-5 figure job, or 3 figure job. Would likely pay out of pocket if the latter to avoid insurance premiums going up.

Any advice? Home is in England and insurer is Aviva if it matters. "

Can't log into my previous account, but wanted to give an update.

I took the advice from /r/LegalAdvice and attempted to do the following:

*""In this order.*

1. *Police report and pull together what information you have and give the police the date and time you will be having this Individual leave.*
2. *Immediate notice is reasonable in this scenario you do not need six weeks more.*
3. *Give the updated notice in writing for him to immediately quit the property and have a witness present when you deliver it. I would truly recommend having a few family or friends there as witnesses not just one person. Whilst his items are being removed also ensure everybody remains with you. If he refuses the notice and/or threatens you (as you will have witnesses, make sure one of them has their phone recording throughout if they can safely do so) call the police.*
4. *Pre-arrange for the date a lock smith to come whilst your witnesses are there and do a full lock change so you can bolt the door once he has gone.*
5. *You may wish to pop in some nest or similar cameras on the entrance etc in addition.*
6. *You may also want a family member to stay a few nights afterwards just so you aren’t alone if he comes back.""*

I went to the police station on the evening of my first post. I explained what was going on - that I had a lodger who was refusing to leave, and pretending that he was an actual tenant.

Police agreed to return with me that evening for the eviction, but I had to wait close to 4 hours in the station. Whenever the officers arrived at my house the lodger opened the front door and spoke with the officers. He presented them with the fake contract, stating that he was renting this place, that I was the landlord, and that I was attempting an illegal eviction.

At this point the police informed me that they didn't have enough evidence to make a decision on what amounted to a civil matter. I tried to enter my property, the lodger stopped me and said I was trespassing as a landlord legally has to give 24 hours notice if they wish to enter.

The police sided with the lodger and informed me I would have to find alternative accommodation.

I ended up having to stay in a dog-friendly BnB for a full week while I spoke with my homeowners insurance and my bank. I also tried to escalate with the police, but they refused to get involved in a civil matter.

Upon returning to my property after a couple of days I discovered my keys no longer work, so it appears the lodger has changed the locks.

I'm now living for free with a friend from my church while my home insurance is working with a solicitor (and hopefully my bank) to apply more pressure to the police to take action against the lodger.

Not a happy situation at present, I'm afraid."

My family home has my name on it so I'm kind of not FTB, but have no experience at all. I binge read this sub and gain a lot of knowledges from all of you, thank you!

So good news is my offer got accepted for a flat, however from the EA I learned that the seller is still (will have to?) searching for a place to buy, so the chain is unknown.

I already provided my solicitor details to the EA, they have changed the flat to SOLD STC, I also got my mortgage advisor involved and is now preparing the massive amount of documents they require.

I believe the last thing (for now) I have to do is to find a surveyor, which I have referral from friend as well as some quotes online.

Question now is, I do not know when to get a surveyor involved? Because there's really no timeline, as long as the seller not finding their next property to buy, we can never proceed... Shall I still find a surveyor now? Or I shall wait for how long or until when?

Bonus question: Due to the curcumstances, I want to buy a Home Buyers Insurance, can anyone provide me some recommendations? I googled it but can only find one ""Home Owners Alliance"", all other results seem direct me to home insurance, not home buyer insurance...

Any tips would be greatly appreciated as well!!

Insurance company delays possibly causing more water damage ,unpredictable90,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bbzveh/insurance_company_delays_possibly_causing_more/,"So we have a slow leak in our bathroom from the tap that led to water dripping through the light socket into our kitchen (sent on holiday so discovered when we came back). Contacted our home insurance and they are sending out someone to investigate in 3 weeks time. 

We have wrapped a towel around the tap to stop the actual leak onto floor and into kitchen but in theory the leak could also be inside the sink where we can’t see it (although that’s unlikely as water is not coming through ceiling any more) 


So, my questions are: 
a) what are we supposed to do in the meantime while we wait the 3 weeks? We have no lights downstairs as we have turned off power for fire risk. Water is still on which in theory we could turn off but would then have to move out….
b) if more damage is caused in the 3 weeks then will instance cover it? 
c) if we turn off water and move out, who pays for that? 

It’s our first home and I’ve never dealt with insurance companies before so I’m not sure how it all works - sorry if these are really obvious things

Lack of Building Regs on Roof Work,oldhaggus2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1cj59aj/lack_of_building_regs_on_roof_work/,"Hello, I’ve recently had an offer accepted on a property. 

It’s been discovered that the previous owners (the ones before the vendors) completed building works without the required building regulations approval.

Namely
1. Fitting new (heavier) roof tiles to the main roof
2. Constructing a conservatory which is open to the main living space. Ie they removed the external rated door between the space and kitchen.

My solicitor has been very thorough and we have received an insurance indemnity policy from the vendors. However I have concerns..

Does this impact the value of the property at all? What’s sort of within my rights to ask for a refund?

Does this also impact home insurance?

As for the conservatory I plan on reducing the offer in line with the cost of reinstating the door. (Amongst other things)

My main concern is the roof - for good reason and I’m not really sure how to approach this.

Insurance question ,Equivalent_Pound_604,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ayzpe3/insurance_question/,"Hi everyone,

My partner and I were FTBs and have been in our first home for a month now. It’s a Victorian terraced house in need of A LOT of love. 

Since moving in I’ve experienced a lot of anxiety regarding the property, particularly in regards to the structure of it 

I know that these fears are unwarranted as we had a level 3 survey carried out which found the house to be fine. However due to the age of the house and the constant creaking I have nightmares about the ceiling caving in.

From what I’ve seen of others posts, it seams fairly normal to have these worries when moving in to your first house having rented all your life. 

Something that would put my mind at ease would be to know whether, say in the worst case scenario, the ceiling fell in randomly, would this be covered by home insurance? We have Admiral basic home/contents insurance but I’m thinking of upgrading to something else to peace of mind. 

Any advice on overcoming these initial anxieties would be much appreciated, thanks! "

FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Popocorno95,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/142lh5c/ftb_uk_homesurvey_or_not/,"Hi all,

I'm a UK based FTB who's pretty far through the process of buying an 8 year old property. I mentioned in passing to my mortgage advisor about booking in a Level 2 homebuyers survey some point soon and he actively advised against it. Said it would be a waste of money on a house so new. I decided against taking his word for gospel because to be honest he's not been the best for advice and has made multiple errors or judgement calls so far in the process, so I took his advice with a pinch of salt.

I just mentioned to a colleague about booking a Homebuyers survey and he also echoed the statement it was the biggest waste of money he invested in, and he paid for a Level 3 structural survey. He said not only did it flag up as false negatives on 90% of the house structure, it missed the biggest and most dangerous structural fault of the house, and also increased his home insurance by a significant amount. Unfortunately he said that homebuyers surveys are not legally binding and he had no legal recourse for the missed dangerous fault. Not sure how true this is?

Now he was buying an old Victorian property, so the circumstances are a bit different, but I have seen many mixed reviews on how in depth and reliable these surveys are. I've seen a lot of reports that they mark everything as Amber to cover their backs should their be a fault, and should this affect my home insurance quotes I might be less inclined to want to pay for one.

Flood damage insurance claim advice,firsttimebuyer37,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/18anxdd/flood_damage_insurance_claim_advice/,"Hi, I’m a FTB and 3 months into owning my home, and had a classic emergency over the weekend, and could do with some advice on how to proceed with insurance claim…

I’ve had a flood from my bath waste pipe in the bathroom (first floor) which has damaged my kitchen ceiling - no more than a few litres of water by the looks of it, it’s not affected the electrics (lucky considering the light is very close to where the water came through) and it seems to have only cosmetically damaged the already pretty old and gross wallpapered ceiling. This one’s been on my long list to update behind a ton of other improvements. 

The leak itself has been repaired by a plumber through home emergency cover. I started a home insurance claim to cover the work needs to repair the kitchen ceiling and have been quoted an excess of £600. Which seems a LOT to pay towards something cosmetic which probably wouldn’t cost much more if I went through a contractor myself. 

So I’m thinking of not submitting the claim, but I’m worried that if I don’t submit it, then later down the line some other damage might emerge, would I not be able to submit a claim because I didn’t submit anything when the issue first arose? I just don’t want to be on the hook for a £600 excess and probably a higher premium next year if I don’t need to be. Thanks in advance!"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1666jkx/seller_caused_subsidence_and_didnt_declare_it/,"Purchased a semi-detatched house recently, and I've been informed by my immediate neighbours that there's an on-going dispute between the previous owner and the neighbours behind the property regarding trees causing subsidence on the neighbours conservatory. I'm worried about subsidence on the main property, and I'm going to get a survey done. If subsidence is found, can I claim it on my insurance or hold the lender viable?

I didn't get a building's survey done before completion, only the survey conducted via the mortgage lender as the property is a new build (around 17 years old). However I did ask the vendor prior to completion about the mature trees around the property. She stated in writing that there are no trees on the property that are our responsibility and there are no disputes with the neighbours over dangerous or problematic trees so I continued with the purchase.

Low and behold, turns out she planted multiple trees, two of which have caused subsidence. The private road/driveway at the bottom and the neighbours conservatory/extension.

Do I have any hope of claiming on my home insurance if any works are to be done?

I'm going to be in touch with my solicitor because I've been told by friends who work in legal departments that there might be a course od action because it appears she likely purposefully lied or concealed the fact there's subsidence.

Ofc, I know this is only really something my solicitor can give solid advice on, but I wanted to see if anyone had any words of advice!"

To buy or not to buy - Long read sorry!,Abij89,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/12tb7as/to_buy_or_not_to_buy_long_read_sorry/,"
Hello, 

I should be less than one month away from buying what I thought was my dream home.

I knew there was some structural movement from the home report (Scotland) which was fixed. The HR said that guarantees for the fix should be sought.

I've been told today that the works weren't guaranteed by the builder as it is an insurance job.

I also read the insurance paperwork which stated that nearly every room in the house had a crack before the work was carried out, which is way more severe that I was lead to believe. 

There is a certificate of structural adequacy from the insurer that paid the claim but that's all I've got.

The subsidence was apparently caused buy issues with the drains and I don't know if these issues still exist. The house has been empty since the works were carried out  (estate sale).

The surveyor who did the home report has basically said if I'm happy with the findings then he is but I'm not.

My solicitor is pushing for the house to have its value readjusted on the basis of this finding.

I am at a loss what to do. 

If I was to push for a structural survey from a structural surveyor rather than a valuation one who would pay for it? Me or the seller?

The history of subsidence makes my home insurance quotes at least £200 PA more expensive.

I don't know if the lack of guarantees will void any future subsidence claims. 

Basically should I buy this house or not?! Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry if this is the wrong sub, I offered a lot over the valuation for this house so now I'm lost.

Thanks"

Suggestions Needed for Dealing with Potential Water Leak,mtrun,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1crpj30/suggestions_needed_for_dealing_with_potential/,"Hi all,

I need some suggestions.

My water company installed a smart water meter for my house yesterday. However, I've noticed an unusual issue when checking the meter reading. Despite extremely low water usage yesterday afternoon, the meter reading is increasing steadily. I even turned off the inside stop valve, but the meter continues to register usage at the same rate. Within just 8 hours of installation, the reading exceeded 1 m3, which seems exceptionally high.

I called the water company this morning but they said they will only check the reading in 2 weeks and see if the consumption is higher than usual. I am not very happy with their response. I don't want to leave a potential leaking for 2 weeks.  
  
Anyone experienced similar situation in the past? Should I talk to my home insurance for this (where the leaking isn't fully confirmed yet)? Or should I hire a private plumber to detect leaks?  
  
Any suggestions are really appreciated! Thanks."
How much did claiming on your house insurance affect your renewal?,used_bathwater,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/14gvgiu/how_much_did_claiming_on_your_house_insurance/,"Hi all. Only owned my gone for 6 months and recently got curious about how home insurance works when you make a claim. 

I'm presuming it's similar to car insurance where the more claims you make - the more your premiums will be next year. Does the premium next year depend on how much the previous claim amounted to or is it just usually dependant on amount of claims?

Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,roxieh,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1dk5o6q/please_help_me_manage_expectations_about_a/,"Buying on my own after a break up. It's rough.

Found a mid 2 bed terrace, 1900s, south east.

I will have around £15k cash on completion (assuming I don't pull out). Probably spent near 2k already on solicitors, mortgage, surveys, etc.

Front wall needs re-render and internal wall replastering because of damp damage. Estimated 4k.

Electrics not checked since '93. Fuse board has items installed incorrectly / wrong way around meaning even when things switched off, items still live. No EICR on record for the property ever. Currently occupied by young family of 4, purchased in 2015 (I have no idea why they never checked electrics). Electrician states full rewire would be needed in order to sign off a EICR. He works with the contractor who'd do the render and plaster. So could the contractor could also make good disruption / damage to electrics? Also the sockets are all double sockets and look modern? 

I'm a single woman with 2 cats and average salary. I work at home.

Is this... Doable? Surely I would need a valid EICR to get home insurance and thus my mortgage? (mortgage app already approved). Can they rewire with minimal damage? I don't have the funds to redecorate and replaster an entire house, kitchen, bathroom. I can't retile everything etc. Not immediately anyway.

They have said I would need to vacate the house for a week for the rewire (this is fine). Just. Is this too much? Estimated 5k for full rewire. 

Current vendors have agreed to contribute to cost of damp repairs and electrics.

If I walk, I lose the buyers on my current place and the £2kish I've already spent, and all the time since Jan trying to sell and buy.

Got a second opinion from another electrician I trust, he said a new fuse board would be an absolute must and even then might still not be able to sign off as safe even with works pending. He also said these issues are common for houses in this area of that age and most things I buy would need something like that. 

Advice / reassurance appreciated. I don't want to live in a building site. I just wanted a new home to settle into away from my situation. "

The day after moving in, I noticed our meter reading had significantly increased. Since then, the water board have been out and confirmed there is a leak on our side and that there was no further role for them, the water board are unable to tell me when the leak appears to have started. I checked with Conveyancing solicitor who basically said the cost of pursuing the previous owner would outweigh the cost of repair. The leak is at a rate of 1 litre per 7 seconds, I am also concerned that the leaking water could be causing other issues under ground (I have not basement). The house is a 1930's semi.

I made a claim on home insurance, they've had a contractor out who have located a leak under the house. It now looks like insurance company won't pay out as they're saying this may have happened before the insurance was taken out. (Insurance was effective from 13th December, we didn't move in until 21st December). The contractor quoted £3500 to the insurance company, but I don't know if that includes the costs of the investigations up to now, or if that's just the cost of the repair.

The repair they are suggesting is to bring a water pipe out of the ground and run it through the house above ground level, diverting the water away from the faulty pipes. The alternatives seem to be digging up the flooring or digging a trench around the front, side and rear of the house and bring a new pipe out of the ground there and into the house much close to where the original pipe comes up through the floor.

The insurer is awaiting a final decision from the underwriter and this is expected in the next few days. Assuming this does not go my way, my next steps will be to get quotes from the contractor directly and other local plumbers.

Just wondering if anyone can advise anything else I can be doing to increase chance of underwriter covering, or reducing costs.

Would it be possible to somehow claim off previous owner's insurance? Assuming he was insured, although I would expect his insurers to say the damage may have been caused after he moved out.

Property purchase - subsidence issue,Intrepid-Rub-3304,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/125kn6l/property_purchase_subsidence_issue/,"[England]

Hello all,
 
I am currently in the process of purchasing a property, and it has recently come to light that there has been a claim on the home insurance to repair some damage caused by subsidence, which was identified as being caused by a leaking drain nearby.
 
The issue was around 6 years ago.
 
The remedial work was carried out, and a certificate of structural adequacy was issued.
 
There was no underpinning required, and it was decided that no further monitoring was required.
 
I'm now at a bit of a crossroad as to how to proceed.
 
It concerns me that the house valuation / mortgage valuation all took place without the knowledge of this issue.
 
Home insurance premiums are also a concern.
 
At the time of getting my building survey done, I went with level 2. Had I been aware of this previous issue I would have gone for a level 3.
 
I'm assuming a structural survey might be the next logical step to take from here?
 
I have also heard mentions of indemnity policies coming into the equation in situations like this...
 
Any general help or advice greatly appreciated!!
 
Thanks"

Insuring a house with missing building regulation certs,EvilWeekThrowaway,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/12lqgds/insuring_a_house_with_missing_building_regulation/,"We're in England. FTBs.

We're near exchange on a standard construction house that was heavily renovated in 2020, including a garage conversion, W/C installation, new windows, a section of roof relaid. We had a survey done which says the work appears to be a good standard but the current owner does not have certs for some of the non-structural work, most likely because he did the work himself.

Our lender is happy to proceed with indemnity insurance. However, we've been advised that a lack of certs could invalidate our home insurance, even though I can't see anything specific in the policies I've been looking at which makes this obvious to me. We spoke to a broker and they seem to be saying our only option is non-standard insurance, which is eye-wateringly expensive.  

It seems like missing certs are a pretty common thing, so I don't know if anyone here has experience with this?  We have an emergency fund and we'd probably only claim on insurance for something catastrophic, so how risky would it be to get a standard policy for absolutely dire situations unrelated to renovations only?"

Removed part of a supporting wall but did not get building regs consent. What should I do?,Junior-Ad7155,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/103uzm0/removed_part_of_a_supporting_wall_but_did_not_get/,"
My partner and I just renovated a house. The builder removed the middle section of a supporting wall and installed an RSJ, as per structural engineer’s calculations & drawings. They plastered it up before someone from the council building regulations could come and check it out. As such, we don’t have consent (which I understand you can get retrospectively) and we don’t have confirmation that it’s all good. 

I’m worried that to get retrospective consent we will need to take all the plaster off just so the guy can check, which will be expensive, but if we don’t do that then home insurance could be voided… 

Has anyone been in the same position or can offer advice?


UPDATE: Thank you for all the great advice and perspectives. We are going to just get it checked ASAP, just applied for a regularisation certificate from Haringey Council which cost £390. That plus the cost of covering up the exposed area (which they assured me would be small) seems with it."
Underpinning during extension works but no building control paperwork,RelativeSafety1859,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1dz4xc7/underpinning_during_extension_works_but_no/,"We are trying to buy a house where a big extension was done in 2006 after getting planning permission. The council planning permission says “Underpinning and extension”. The house is really nice. Surveyor did notice the underpinning in records but did not make it an issue. He was the bank’s surveyor so valued the house at the correct/agreed price with no issues. According to the surveyor nothing to indicate any issues structurally (He is not a structural surveyor of course).

Our solicitors have raised this and asked for paperwork. The vendor has sent over some architectural drawings which talks about underpinning but when asked about building control sign off, the vendor responded by saying that they never got it. So our solicitors have gone back (without asking me), to push for a retrospective Building control inspection to sign off the works.

My question are:
1.	Is it common to have underpinning done when extending? It was a big extension, small bungalow to an almost 200sqm house. Our environmental survey did point the whole area as having soft soil so the whole town is at high risk of subsidence.
2.	Was there even a requirement to get things signed off by Building control back in 2006?
3.	How much would this bother anyone?
4.	Would home insurance be an issue? Some of them ask if there ever was underpinning and some specifically ask about subsidence.

Anyhow, we are not moving into the house as we would like to renovate, paint, change the carpet so we are staying put with my parents until we fix up the house for another month. 

I have never rented before so I just wanted to understand the process. I have the details from the previous owners, who their current Gas, Electric and Water supplier is, do I just call them up to let them know, we took possession of the house yesterday, do they take our details so they can start a new account in our name?

  
Council Tax, so we will pay monthly, how do we set this up in our name, what is the process. 

  
Our home insurance is already in place and we just paid annually as it was just cheaper to do. Broadband, I am just searching for deals and won't install until we are ready to move in so any ideal, how to get the best deal? My current household, we have virgin, do think it be a good ideal to call virgin, to see if we can get a deal for our household. 

  
Also, we don't watch TV, I normally use youtube or netflix or download my shows so never is the need to watch live tv so I have no need for a TV License. How can I go about and just cancelling this as I think the previous owner, they have freeview or some connection in the living room but we don't really use this or want it.

Will we be able to get our mortgage approved? Our lender is Nationwide and I have seen they have requested some people sign a letter confirming the loft is not a habitable room. What does this mean in practice?

Best way to proceed given no building regulations for an attic room?,Kyan1te,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/tfurmw/best_way_to_proceed_given_no_building_regulations/,"Hello, I'm a FTB who's recently found a property advertised as 3 bedrooms. The only catch is that, it has an attic room. It is possible to get to the attic room via standard stairs through a door on the 1st floor landing. The attic room is not being labelled as a 4th bedroom. It is big enough for storage, to have a walk around (as long as you stay central) & potentially use as a small office.

After investigating prior to making an offer, the owners who have lived in the house for years (they are downsizing so they are elderly) say that they have no planning permission for it nor any building regulation documents as it was done a long time ago.

I'm trying to figure out the answers to a couple of questions (I've already searched a lot of threads in this subreddit that seem to address issues around this type of problem):

\- Whilst I have an AIP both from Barclays (& another from L&C), how can I get confirmation that they would provide a loan for the property without building regulations? (e.g. if it had indemnity insurance)

\- Indemnity insurance aside, how will no building regulations affect home insurance in general? If the attic decides to magically start to crumble one day, am I right in assuming that home insurance will not cover any of it?

\- Is the best way forward - after getting confirmation from Barclays that they will finance the property - to get an offer accepted & then leave it to the solicitors to try & find some evidence of building regulations in some old records somewhere? (Couldn't find any planning permission records online)

\- If I take out Home Buyers Protection insurance, will it cover me for all fees if I decide to ""conveniently withdraw"" after the solicitors point out the lack of building regulations further down the line?

They’ve quoted about £1,500 for the cover, so I just want to make sure it’ll likely be accepted and useful before spending the money!"
Offer accepted on dream property but it’s on a flood plain,mastershaz88,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/12mjdo6/offer_accepted_on_dream_property_but_its_on_a/,"We recently bid and won a sealed bid offer for a property, but have now found out it sits on a flood plain. I believe it’s level 3, and the government site mentions it as high risk. 

I’ve lived in nearby villages all my life and never heard of the area being flooded - apart from once, and that again wasn’t necessarily a big flood. 

What is my best course of action? Get a surveyor in to check thoroughly? Offer less after finding this out? Pull out completely? 

We love the house, but now that we know this and the increase it’ll bring with home insurance, we’re debating our offer. 

All advice welcome - thanks"
"Just bought my first home, pick up the keys in a few days, what are the first things I need to take care of?",sensors,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/ud696q/just_bought_my_first_home_pick_up_the_keys_in_a/," Taking a big life step at the end of the week as I get the keys to my first home, but I'm pretty clueless about what needs done financially in the run up to this....

Is there anything specific I need to do?

What do I have to do with gas/electricity providers?

When should I sort out home insurance?"
First time buyers & water leaks,devotchkaa,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/17zo9hp/first_time_buyers_water_leaks/,"We bought our house from our landlord earlier this year, we had no issues raised on the L3 survey & have lived here for 4 years with no issue but the last few months everything has started to go wrong.

We found there was a slow drip leak behind a radiator so needed to call in a plumber however the room with the stop tap is unaccessible. First it was locked by our neighbour, she lost her key & none of the keys we have fit. She called in a locksmith who has changed the lock but now the door itself has jammed shut due to the excessively wet weather. The handyman she has hired to fix the door says we need at least two dry days & it's been over a week on none stop rain. I tried to get in myself, it's completely wedged shut & won't move at all.

Yesterday I've now found another drip leak from the bath, it's not caused any noticeable damage yet but obviously will if allowed to continue.

We weren't going to claim on the home insurance as it's a £750 excess for 'escape of water' but now it looks like we will have to. We still can't access the stop clock & the shared access area is on our neighbours property so the handymen I've spoken to don't want to break in.

I have no idea what to do, we have no family to ask for help. Can I just raise a claim with my insurance & they'll handle everything including gaining access to the stop clock room or do I have to get in to the room first before raising a claim?"
Flood risk on a separate parcel of land from the house,tubaleiter,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/14jqvtc/flood_risk_on_a_separate_parcel_of_land_from_the/,"Bit of a strange one, wanting second opinions beyond our solicitor (maybe this belongs in r/LegalAdviceUK, but it's a housing specific question so figured I'd start here).

Situation is that we're buying a house that consists of three parcels of land. The main parcel includes the house and the bulk of the garden. The other two parcels are extensions of the back garden, further away from the house. Importantly, these two parcels include a winterbourne chalk stream. As streams do, this one occasionally rises a bit, and the vendors have said that it occasionally (maybe once a year) floods into the far (non-house) side of the stream, which is a water meadow. No structures, just empty land. On the house side of the stream, the water has never gone more than maybe a metre beyond it's normal flow.

Question is - obviously there's a flood risk on these two additional parcels, because they include a stream. But there's nothing there except back garden, no structures beyond a simple DIY bridge and pontoon in the stream, maybe £1,000 worth, which we'd happily self-insure. There's no flood risk to the house or the parcel of land that includes the house, the flood searches came back as ""Very Low"" risk from rivers and the sea.

When you mention flooding from the stream to insurers, the price triples. We can afford it just fine, but seems like we'd be paying a few hundred a year to insure against a risk to essentially empty land and flooding in a water meadow that has flooding as it's very purpose.

So should we be disclosing this flooding risk *in a separate parcel of land* for our home insurance? Or because it's a separate parcel we'd only be insuring against flood risk for the house and it's associated land, and thus no need to disclose anything about flooding?"
"2 bed - 185k valuation - due to no regs - now 1 bed, still valued at 185k by bank...",flameonkayser,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/15i0us8/2_bed_185k_valuation_due_to_no_regs_now_1_bed/,"Long story short: 
We made an offer on property, at 185k. Offer accepted, mortgage approved, then bank surveyor came by and they found that 2nd bedroom loft conversion got no building regs.

To allow further processing, bank required us to sign statement that second bedroom will not be used, as it should not be habitable. We did sign it just out of curiosity what value will property get.

So bank had to re-valuate property, and they came back with... 185k. From 2 bed into 1 bed. Same value.

Our solicitor was also surprised. 
Bank was NatWest.

We did RICS lvl3, and they came with 35k less value...

Cost of getting second bedroom loft conversion up to current regs is approx 50k (got quotes...)

Is it normal for bank to give same value to property when it is downgraded from 2 bed into 1 bed?

I understand that my home insurance will be actually void if something will happen to property, even if second bedroom will not be habitable - there is live electric and plumbing there installed - combi boiler..."
What would you do: Leak from upstairs coming through lights,Remanufacture88,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/z8281t/what_would_you_do_leak_from_upstairs_coming/,"We are living in a leasehold maisonette on the ground floor, our neighbours upstairs are also leasehold with the same company. Earlier a small drip started out of our light socket in the bathroom. We alerted our neighbours and turned off the water and the drip has now stopped. 

Our neighbours have since arranged an emergency plumber to arrive this evening. What more do we need to do? Is this a home insurance, contents insurance situation? It’s our first grown up dilemma since moving in and my partner has motor neurone disease and we are going through a bit of a tough point so I barely have the capacity to add another issue on the pile."
EA wants to arrange viewings on our current rental when we are not home - help!,muddledmedic,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/s01423/ea_wants_to_arrange_viewings_on_our_current/,"Hi everyone, myself and my husband completed on a house just under a month ago, and will be vacating our rental at the end of January. 

We got a call from the estate agent on Friday saying they have had some interest (I cant find the house on their website or rightmove, so imagine its internal advertising so far), and would like to arrange some viewings. They asked if they could visit the house when we are not home, and my husband said no. They explained that they would want us out of the property whilst they complete viewings, and that they would have a chat with our letting agents (a seperate company) about this. My husband took the call, and did not tell them why our answer was no, but its because we have 2 house cats (one whom is very shy and can be nasty with new people, and one who loves to run between peoples feet to escape) and I would be uncomfortable with anybody in the house with them whilst I am not present for their safety and also the safety/sanity of the EA and viewers just in case one escapes or the other gets a little nasty. I am going to call them and tell them this tomorrow. Our availibility for viewings is pretty poor tbh as we are in the new house renovating most evenings and every weekend, but we will be moving out permnantly in a couple of weeks time (about 1 week before the tenancy is up) so they can them come anytime providing they still allow us access to clean. 

Another concern I have is today we noticed a mastersafe key deposit box has been fitted to the front of the property. I have no idea who fitted this, why its their and did not know it was even happening. For all I know, this could have been fitted by anyone. I hate these boxes, and I know they void my home insurance policy, so if there are currently any keys in their I want it removed (or I want the code so I can remove the keys) straight away. I am appauled that something can be fitted to the outside of our home without our knowledge or prior permission, and nobody has informed us, especially considering the fact that its contents may render my home insurance invalid. The safe box is on our front porch and you can easily see it from the street. 

TLDR: Can the estate agent demand that they view the property when we are not home and make us vacate in the evenings and on weekends to do this before we move? and Can I demand that the safe deposit box be emptied or removed if it has keys currently in it given the implications for our home insurance policy? and also do I have a leg to stand on if I complain that it was fitted without our knowledge or persmission?"
