Do you have home insurance?,[deleted],21,[deleted]
Do you have home insurance?,monagr,7,"You should get insurance for things you cannot afford to lose. 
You don't need phone insurance if you can afford a new phone. However, if you cannot afford a new home, you should get home insurance"
Do you have home insurance?,jenangeles,5,I thought we didn’t have that much stuff until we had a fire last year. Was very happy to have that insurance and especially happy that we had a policy where they gave us the new value to replace all our stuff.
Do you have home insurance?,Mysterious_Carob1082,10,"I own my home but don't have a mortgage.  Of course I have buildings insurance, it would be mad not to.  But I don't bother with contents insurance because I own very little 'stuff', and I can easily afford to replace it."
Do you have home insurance?,MostlyNormalMan,4,"Anyone who says they don't have contents insurance because they don't have much stuff, or anything of value hasn't thought it through. If the worst happens and you had a house fire, you'd have to replace *everything*. I'm talking carpets, furniture, beds, bedding, towels, curtains, kitchen appliances & utensils, clothes, TV, laptop, phones, cameras and other electrical items, books. The list is huge and gets bigger when you really think about it."
Do you have home insurance?,Independent-Pea9629,7,Any mortgage agreement I’ve ever seen has stipulated that you must have buildings insurance…tbh I think you’d be crazy not to in any circumstance
Do you have home insurance?,geekypenguin91,3,"Home insurance usually consists of two parts, buildings and contents.

Buildings cover the structure of the building. If you have that through a property management company, then there is usually little need for you to have your own.

Contents insurance covers everything inside. A mortgage lender doesn't normally require that you have this, only buildings insurance cover.

As for would I always get it regardless? Yes. A) because I don't get buildings cover from anyone else, and b) because I have a lot of stuff in this house that needs covering. It covers all our jewellery, watches, laptops, bikes, etc even when we're out the home if they're lost or stolen. It covers everything in the house in case of floors, water leaks, fires etc, and it covers everything in the home for accidental damage (granted were unlikely to claim on that bit)"
Do you have home insurance?,pictish76,2,"You only need building insurance for a mortgage, no mortgage it is up to you. Contents is by your choice."
Do you have home insurance?,PoopyPogy,2,"What do you mean by home insurance? There's building insurance or contents insurance. 

If you own a leasehold flat you probably don't need to get building insurance as your landlord should be sorting it out. Unless it's a converted house sort of set up."
Do you have home insurance?,Kaily6D,2,"We have home insurance. No mortgage. Our house is worth more the  £1m and if the house burned down it would be hit to me financially…..seems silly not to have it.

Now if you have a hut thats under £100k and the loss would not affect you, then thats an individual decision."
Do you have home insurance?,Ornery-Wasabi-1018,2,"What do you mean by ""PS: referring to home insurance, not building insurance bought by property manager""

Are you talking about flats? That's the only place I  can think could have a property manager?

Anyway, we have (and have always had) buildings and contents insurance. No idea if it was in the mortgage terms or not, but since there is no way I could stump up, say 200k to rebuild the house if needed, and equally, the aprox 50k to floor / furnish  a destroyed house, and also equip a kitchen, and clothe the family, I'm insured for those situations.

My phone isn't insured - I have £300."
Do you have home insurance?,vikingdhu,1,we're currently renting and have contents insurance. had a small fire in the kitchen a couple of years back and they paid out for the damage and for new appliances. worth every penny tbh.
Do you have home insurance?,SportTawk,1,"Many people don't have insurance, when Boscastle flooded in 2014 many houses were  not insured, crazy!

A cottage nearby a few years later had no insurance, never got rebuilt.

I think it'd more common than you think not to have house insurance"
Do you have home insurance?,ToeConstant2081,1,"You need it to have a mortgage, why would you not have it it costs like 10 quid a month lol"
Do you have home insurance?,seven-cents,1,Absolutely. For a few hundred quid a year I'm happy to pay it. I think the biggest risk is fire. If my house burnt down I'd be down over 400K and homeless.
Do you have home insurance?,donaldtrumpiscute,-5,What common scenarios do you think will trigger a home insurance payout? In a normal flat in a city
Do you have home insurance?,AlpsSad1364,-3,"It's a few hundred pounds for a standard build house, for a non-standard build house it can be many thousands. 

Mine is thatched, cob and listed: currently I pay around £1500 a year - I got quotes up to £7000 and most mainstream companies refused to quote at all.

Unsurprisingly some people can't afford to pay that so don't and take their chances. There are also buildings that insurers refuse to cover entirely. The village of Hallsands near me has a history of coastal erosion and many of the houses are uninsurable. Doesn't stop people living in them (in the summer anyway) but they're obviously not mortgagable."
Do you have home insurance?,Mysterious_Carob1082,1,"I'm one of those people who said I don't buy contents insurance because I don't own much stuff and could afford to replace it.  And yes, I do mean all the items you've listed."
Do you have home insurance?,Fatauri,1,"Contents insurance must be costly considering how many things it can cover. If you were to be burgled and taken away a lot of items for which you didn't have a receipt, how would you prove them? I'm sure people have a lot of stuff without receipts. 

Also, how would the insurance company deal in a situation where the owner is claiming something is stolen but it actually isn't?"
Do you have home insurance?,UK_FinHouAcc,16,"Insurance is for the uncommon scenarios like fire, flood, burglary etc.

If you rent a property or have a leasehold you get contents insurance, if you own a house get buildings and contents."
Do you have home insurance?,pictish76,3,"As below but contents can also cover accidents like dropping your tv, pet damage and can also cover your items away from home like phones, cameras etc."
Do you have home insurance?,evilotto77,5,Have you stopped to think about the reason the insurance is more expensive though? It's because you're more likely to make a claim on those properties. So those people actually need it more than the people paying a couple of hundred a year
Do you have home insurance?,AlpsSad1364,1,"Lolz at people voting me down for stating facts they don't agree with. Very reddit.

I'm not advocating not getting insurance, I'm explaining why some people don't have it. 🙄"
Do you have home insurance?,geekypenguin91,2,"For the last one that's easy, it's fraud and will be dealt with as such.

For the first, you don't need receipts. Any proof that you had it in the last will be enough, eg photos."
Do you have home insurance?,AlpsSad1364,0,"Needing it isn't the same as being able to pay for it. I am just explaining why some people don't have insurance, probably more than you think."
Do you have home insurance?,[deleted],1,[deleted]
Do you have home insurance?,Fatauri,1,"Sorry for being confusing but having pictures of items sounds less convincing during a claim. E.g house got burgled, called up the insurance company and showed them pictures of stuff i had/or never did have, then the company pays for them just like that?"
Do you have home insurance?,AlpsSad1364,1,"Actually you can't buy insurance on a house until you own it so you don't find out how much it costs until after you've exchanged (ask me how I know).

My insurance when I first bought the house was about £1000 per year. Expensive but given the house not that unreasonable I thought. 2 years later the insurer decided they didn't want to cover old buildings any more and quoted me over £6k to renew. I could only find one other insurer who would quote at the time (who were closer to the original but have a lot of conditions like 5 yearly EICs and quarterly chimney inspections) and if they hadn't I would have been screwed. I can imagine many people in that situation decide to just take their chances.

I wouldn't not buy insurance and I wouldn't buy an uninsurable house, but people who do are going in with their eyes wide open because you will be warned at every point in the process. Actually I think it probably rarely happens. The ones I mentioned seem to mostly have been inherited and the owners can't sell so they just use them as summer homes until they fall into the sea."
Do you have home insurance?,jenangeles,2,"When we had our fire last year and stuff got destroyed, we just provided them with a list of items and the value for each item. A company was supposed to come in and catalog what was ruined and what was restorable but they did such a horrible job at it and lost a bunch of our things when they took them away for restoration. We had receipts for all the big ticket items, jewellery, furniture, etc. but at one point we were trying to remember what else we had in our house and just list it with the value and a link to purchase the item. To a certain extent, the insurance company trusted what we had put down because it was in line with the value of the other things we could prove we had and they did see we had a lot of items in our house when they came to do the initial evaluation of our claim. If you have an entire wardrobe full of primark clothes and a casio watch and then try to claim that you had some cheaper designer clothing (under 1k-2ish per item) that were missing, they’d look at it with a bit more suspicion than if you had items on a similar level value wise."
Do you have home insurance?,geekypenguin91,1,"I'm not talking catalogue pictures of every item, that does look suspect.

But for example if you're claiming for a luxury watch, you can prove you previously owned one if you have a photo of you at a party and the watch is visible.

High value items (usually over £1-2.5k) that aren't listed on your policy won't normally be covered either.

The list of things you tell your insurance also has to match with what you're telling the police was taken, and someone from the insurance comes round to check if what you're saying is reasonable or not.


Any lies you tell us fraud and while I'm sure some people get away with telling the odd fib, people can, and do, get thrown in jail for insurance fraud."

Is home insurance getting more expensive?,FickleOcelot1286,1,Cost me £60 for a 3 bed in December
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,JustAnotherFEDev,1,"I pay like £98 per year for contents only, 3 bedroom house, and I think I have 50 or 60k cover."
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,andDreamofSheep,1,I bought buildings and content insurance yesterday from Halifax for £36 a month. 3 bedroom / 2 bathroom with a small flat roof. Standard stone and slate construction.
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,ShowUsYourHits_,1,"If you tried the comparison websites and the results are all the same you might want to try the insurance broker to see if they could give you a better deal.  

Generally yes.. the insurance has gone through the roof and 600-700 could be the new normal. Ours went from 100 per year building and contents to around 300-400 on a 2 bed"
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,Express-Nobody-7682,1,How close to renewal date are you? I’ve been using the comparison sites for years and I always find the best deals around 4 weeks before my renewal. My last renewal was in April and my insurance ( home and contents) increased by £20-£30 for the year. To give you another example I had a car insurance quote on compare the market which was around my old premium. I didnt take it out straight away and by the time I was interested in purchasing the insurance the quote was not valid and now was £350 dearer as my start date was only a few days away. I ran the same quote but changed my start date to a month later and I got the original quote back.
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,JustMMlurkingMM,1,"Is this a new home, or have you lived there a while? How much has it increased since last year?
Have you made a claim recently? Has crime increased in the area? Has there been flooding anywhere locally? Has anything else changed?

A friend of mine had a tree in his garden blow over in a storm. Insurance paid for repairs to his fence and the tree being removed. The policy next year increased by thousands. There is no additional risk. The tree had gone. They just hate losing money and will claw it back where they can."
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CowboyBob500,1,"I paid around £400 for home and contents combined - £2 million cover for home and £80,000 cover for contents - from LV about 3 weeks ago"
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,Cheap-Cauliflower-51,1,"Mine shot up this year.  Car insurance went down a little but house (buildings with contents) went from 240 to 430.  No claims etc in that year, just huge jump for no apparent reason, and that was hunting around all the cashback and compared sites."
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,is that annually?
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,which area is this if you don't mind me asking?
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,interesting. even for halifX I believe the quote was around 600 per year. which area is this if you don't mind me asking?
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,"yeah I used a comparison website. good point, let me try with the broker directly. thanks!"
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,"I timed it exactly at 1 month, but will try to play around with the dates and try to rerun the quotes in couple of days. thanks!"
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,"not a new home, I'm in the process of buying now so haven't lived there. but the seller made statement that they didn't make any claim when they lived there (+5 years). no crime upticks as well as far as met's website reports"
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,"holy shhh. my cover is less than that (500k home, 40k content). the comparison site I used didn't show anything from LV,  but will give it a shot. thanks!"
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,yikes that's steep. thanks for sharing!
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,FickleOcelot1286,1,Yes
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,JustAnotherFEDev,1,"Humber region. Pretty high crime and poverty.

On Compare the Market, this was the cheapest one for me. I do have 5 years of no claims, though.

I just pay £9 per month. Usually I pay it in a oner, but I'll be moving soon, so just paying monthly and will get a new quote then. 

Urban Jungle was the cheapest this time round."
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,andDreamofSheep,1,South Wales!
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,JustMMlurkingMM,1,"If it’s a new home to you the claim history will probably be based on any claims you made on your previous home, not the current owners claims on the new house.  Our insurance for a five bedroom house is about £800 so you are probably not far off the market."
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CowboyBob500,1,"It was my broker that found it. Maybe he got a better deal? I have heard that companies don’t necessarily offer their best deals on comparison sites either, which may or may not be true"
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,Cheap-Cauliflower-51,1,Buildings and contents?  Seems incredibly cheap
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,2,that sounds really cheap all things considered. thanks for sharing!
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,CaregiverOrnery6580,1,ah I see. thanks for the explanation!
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,FickleOcelot1286,0,"Well not contents no, that would be wasted money."
Is home insurance getting more expensive?,JustAnotherFEDev,2,"So, the good thing about Urban Jungle is that they don't charge extra for paying monthly.

If you can get a quote, it might be worth it for a month or so, if you need to replace locking mechanisms. Then, once you have done that,  just get another whole market quote and choose the best value one.

That's kinda what I'm doing. I'm gonna do similar for buildings insurance, then once I have done the initial renovations and decorating, as well as added security items, such as anti-snap locks and CCTV, I'm gonna get new quotes.

1. For both contents and buildings
2. For separate contents and buildings

Then just see which is best.

It's not an annual contract with my insurance, so I can leave for a new provider at any time, without notice or penalty."

Home insurance,itallstartedwithapub,2,"Sounds like your broker is giving you quotes that secure them the highest commission.

Check the policy wording before you commit, but any building insurance should include flood damage unless it's been excluded due to previous floods. You'll probably be better off going with a comparison site, and £250 sounds more realistic based on the information provided.

The £1m cover is a red herring though, it's common for policies to include high or unlimited building cover these days to prevent the issue of people accidentally underinsuring their property."
Home insurance,prof_UK,1,"Those quote sound crazy high for such an inexpensive property.

Please don't tell me you're paying the broker a fee as well?"
Home insurance,JennyW93,1,"Oh god no, never ever pay for a broker"
Home insurance,prof_UK,1,The difference in prices you're seeing is straight up commission for the insurance agent and likely for the broker that referred you.

Tesco home insurance renewal increase 112%,stewis,5,Same for me…. Went from £90 to £180 told them to jog on and insured with admiral for £80 on a similar policy.  As others have said loyalty is not rewarded even when you have made no claims ever.  Just cancel and have a look on a comparison website.
Tesco home insurance renewal increase 112%,IC_Eng101,5,its normal for insurance policies to shoot up at renewal. Shop around I'll bet you find the same cover under 100.
Tesco home insurance renewal increase 112%,JustAnotherFEDev,2,"Also. When you do comparisons on insurance (or literally anything), always do it in an incognito/private browser and close it between each comparison site.

Tesco home insurance renewal increase 112%,purte,1,Did you have any claims in the previously insured period? Insurance companies have a habit of getting rid of customers who (in their view) are going to cost them too much in claims by hiking up the premiums to make you go elsewhere.

I just paid it off all at once, but next year, will look for cheaper, I know I can but just need to make sure, not to get extra. 

Comparison sites are your go to, you will differently get it cheaper, do it one month before it expires and make sure, do it icognito on the browser, so it doesn't track the prices."

Advice for home insurance,itallstartedwithapub,1,"Will the property by empty or occupied when you carry out work?

Advice for home insurance,Mysterious_Carob1082,1,"On the edge of a city next to a national park!  I'm envious.   I'm not sure whether pest/vermin issues are covered under vanilla policies, or houses that are being renovated, so speaking to an insurance broker might clarify whether you need something a bit specialised or not."
Advice for home insurance,Pale_Cow_3120,1,"Thank you for the advice :) for the work itself I will still be a tenant for the first couple of months elsewhere, and worse comes to the worse can live with my parents. The house as is not is not really fit for living RN."

Home Insurance for 6+ bed houses,SwellestMonster,5,"Insurers are notoriously sticklers for details. The spec of the house being a pretty big one. Should you have a total loss of home I’d not be wanting to risk them declining the claim on the basis that you’ve provided false information to pay cheaper premiums.

FTB - Home Insurance,jacekowski,1,"Why not just have both start at the same time, savings are going to be pretty minimal if any.

£118/year for both with aviva."
FTB - Home Insurance,nano-moose,1,"That's a good shout tbf - I had just assumed I needed to do each separately. Not seeing anything as cheap as £118/year anywhere, maybe just particulars in my situation."
FTB - Home Insurance,jacekowski,1,"Are you selecting any stupid options like legal cover, insurance away from home, accidental damage or 0 excess?

I've just ran through through a quote at moneysupermarket and it came out to £84 for cheapest option, but i can easily make it £400 for cheapest quote by adding few extras."
FTB - Home Insurance,nano-moose,1,"Yes except the 0 excess lol. Was told by a colleague to add legal cover. Got my bike, laptop and camera insured away from home. Thought accidental damage would be good if I'm redoing bits of the house. Why don't you think they're necessary?"
FTB - Home Insurance,jacekowski,2,"Because you are paying £300/year extra for that cover, with minimum excess of around £200 (maybe more if you add voluntary excess) and if you use the policy you will be slapped with increase in your insurance costs so high that you will regret ever claiming on it. So it is better to save that money and spend it on replacing/fixing it yourself.

Insurances companies never lose money (in the long term, they will lose money in short term) which should tell you something, It is always cheaper to self insure in long term, it is worth it to insure against rare catastrophic events because it would take very long time to recover from something like that (for example with £100 building insurance for house with 250k rebuild cost would take 208 years to recoup the cost if house burned down, but houses burn down a lot less frequently on average so insurance company still wins here), but paying £300/year + £200 per event to insure laptop worth £500 (have a look how much your laptop or camera is worth on ebay - insurance company will not be replacing yours with a new one, but giving you money for the value of your current laptop/camera and your £1000 camera/laptop is only worth fraction of that year later)"
FTB - Home Insurance,nano-moose,1,"Thanks! My laptop and camera are both >£2000 (camera worth more to me personally as laptop I wouldn't mind replacing with something cheaper), so for the next year at least I think it's worth insuring those, laptop will probably decrease in value after that tbh so maybe I don't insure it after. I'll continue comparing prices though to see if I can work out something cheaper"
FTB - Home Insurance,jacekowski,1,"If you really want to insure your camera, get separate insurance for it. You really do not want to claim on your contents insurance as single claim can easily add £1k/year to the premiums (and claim on building/content insurance has to be declared forever so it will hurt you even 20 years down the line), it's very rarely worth it to claim for things that cost less than ~5k to fix.

Also, they don't care about how much camera/laptop is worth to you, but what is the market value of a 1 year old camera."

Is this new, or just specific to some lenders? NatWest didn’t ask for this last time I bought. It was just part of the terms that I did have to have it insured but I didn’t have to prove it"
Arranging Home Insurance before Exchange,MomoSkywalker,1,"Congrats first. Yes, I saw a mention of this so would like to get this prepared as this would be needed after exchange. 

Can I ask, how you did your insurance? I will have a check on gocompare and google some other ones. Hopefully I can find one."
Arranging Home Insurance before Exchange,MomoSkywalker,2,">Thanks, yes the broker does have one company they use, but they are on the pricey side. I am just going to take it with them, as you have 14 day cooling off period so if we like it, we will keep it, or just cancel after completion but have home insurance in place to start after cancellation."
Arranging Home Insurance before Exchange,PoopyPogy,2,"It's conveyancers firm's policies. It's good practice for them to ask to see your insurance policy because they ought to check on behalf of the mortgage lender that you've done it right...

Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,jacekowski,51,"That is very high. 

The only benefit of that policy is for the mortgage advisor who will get a cut from it.

https://www.comparethemarket.com/home-insurance/"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Streathamite,19,Is the house unusual in any way? Listed building/thatched roof etc? Is it in an area prone to flooding and does the insurance cover flood damage? Is it high risk for subsidence and does the policy cover subsidence? If any of these things apply then that could explain the high premium. If none of these issues apply then it seems very high and you should shop around. However remember that with insurance the cheapest policy is definitely not the best so make sure you have all the cover you might need.
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Bodster88,13,"I would expect £200-250 MAX for a fully comprehensive buildings and contents policy with all the bells, whistles and accidental damage.

Just use a comparison website."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,h_p_bitchcraft,6,"Mine was £116 last year with policy expert. They did try to up it to £167 but I got a requote as a new customer for £137 so yeah yours is mad high.

*3bed terrace with same rebuild value"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,jimmyrosssss,9,Way too high unless you’re living in a gigantic house. Ours was £110 for a 2-bed flat in Sussex. Done through Compare the Market.
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,treeseacar,4,"The broker is likely not whole of market so you are not getting the cheapest quote from them. The broker does likely get a commission from the mortgage advisor which is why you've been referred. 

I'd ignore them and see out your own quotes from a a comparison site. MSE is a good resource for this.

https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/insurance/home-insurance/"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,PandaPopsandDrops,3,"We were paying £37 a month through our broker, just renewed with gocompare and got the same cover for £12 a month. Top tip is to use topcashback to get your  home insurence through gocompare and you get £35 cashback :)"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,IC_Eng101,2,"4 bed detached, integrated double garage, 1980s build, standard construction. 3 bathrooms, 4 bedrooms, 3 reception rooms. Not near any water sources or large trees.  £110 per year."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,shenme_,2,That’s super high
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,daudder,1,"As said by others, way too high.

I would switch mortgage advisers since yours is obviously not out to get you the best deal, but rather to get you the best deal for themselves.

There are good ones out there. Look for near-5 star rated firms on TrustPilot."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Whispybicycle,1,"Not enough information provided to make any kind of judgement on whether this is expensive or not. Everyone commenting that it's too much and that they only paid £100 means nothing as they aren't OP.

Price comparison sites are just that, they don't compare cover.

Welcome to keep picking the cheapest option, but don't complain if they don't pay your claim.

That said, I would advise looking around yourself. If you have a standard property and cover levels, you can get loads of quotes online. But check the cover and reviews of the insurers."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Saikosune,1,"Used to work in Insurance, one of the first things you learn there is broker policies are ridiculously overpriced.

I've seen people with £1200 PA policies when we could have done it direct for about £200.

I'd never take a broker policy, I'd just use it to laugh at the premium."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,brajandzesika,-1,"Its around 4 times higher than you should pay.
Mortgage advisor trying to rip you off, you'd better check if the mortgage he found for you isnt more expensive than what you can find yourself on moneysupermarket or other comparison websites.
Are you paying for his service? If yes- ditch him entirely, go with free mortgage advisor."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,whythehellnote,-1," any (estate agents, mortgage brokers etc) trying to double-dip like this should be named and shamed and avoided. 

I'd like to see this type of scam made illegal"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,trcocam29,0,"A lot of comments about this being too high, which no one can comment upon without knowing details about your property. 

For what it is worth, we pay slightly over £1500 per year, for comprehensive buildings and contents cover, and some ""out and about"" items, but not including emergency callout cover. This sounds VERY high compared to other commenters' rates, but we have a 7 bathroom house, outbuildings, and part of the estate dates from 1600s, which can all add to pricier cover. Just check with some third parties.

EDIT: I just went on a comparison website, out of pure curiosity. Only 2 providers were able to offer us a quote, not including our current provider (!), and one was just over £1500, whilst the other was £5500. Bit of a disparity there!"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Laurenhynde82,1,It takes no time to go through compare the market or similar. I just did it for a purchase - £170 was the best quote (rebuild value was estimated at £400k which seems bonkers as the house is only £432k). When we did our mortgage application they offered us “discounted” insurance as customers - it was about £600. Just get your own.
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,TravelOwn4386,1,Just do a home insurance comparison site to check your own findings i assume you do this for car insurance if you drive? It will be the same process. It's free to get quotes.
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Proud_Fee_1542,1,"That’s pretty high. Take a look on comparison sites and see what it gives you so you have something to compare it against. Then If I were you I would just tell the mortgage advisor that you’ve found cheaper insurance elsewhere and you don’t need them to arrange it.

The mortgage advisor might try to talk you into taking their insurance but don’t be afraid to say no. They’re just pushy about it because they get commission for insurance that they sell. Don’t let them rip you off just so they can get some extra money!"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Genghis_Kong,1,"EDIT: I don't think the below is necessarily true, in the cold light of day. I'd always recommend doing a bit of your own research to sense-check what your advisor is recommending, but no reason to assume every mortgage advisor is trying to do you over.

ORIGINAL POST:
Lol never trust a mortgage 'advisor' for anything. They're salesmen, pure and simple. And they're trying to take you for a ride.

Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Section419,2,Pls do me provider
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,mattscazza,4,"This comment is unfair. Mortgages are regulated and the Mortgage Adviser is duty bound to act in the best interests of the client. Quite often Insurance is upsold on a non advised basis and therefore they can offer any policy for any sort of reason. We don't have enough info to determine why the price is so high, for all we know it could be in a high risk area where the prices are naturally higher, the adviser could be recommending a policy that is based on the best customer service rather than price. Not everything comes down to price, and sometimes people are better paying a higher premium for a better product or service. Regardless, it's a quote, if the OP thinks it's high and can find a better price for the same cover or is happy to accept a lower level of  cover to get the price down then they are free to do so."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Apprehensive-Golf130,1,"""don't complain when they don't pay your claim""

Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,WDayAdviser,2,"While I agree that part of the job does border on a 'salesman' aspect, I think it is very unfair to say mortgage advisers are untrustworthy. We are qualified and heavily regulated in every way possible, and any half decent adviser will always have your best interests at the forefront. And financially speaking, we are better keeping you happy as a loyal client for a lifetime than upselling you for one insurance policy.
There are bad eggs in every industry, and I promise you there's a lot less in mortgage advisers than other industries."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Genghis_Kong,1,"For more useful advice: moneysavingexpert.com for mortgage quotes, comparethemarket.com for insurance. You'll be at his best offers so easily."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,h_p_bitchcraft,1,"Get this right. Even though I've got a new contract with them, they keep emailing saying they need to take the £167. Piss off, you've got £126 from me now."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Whispybicycle,1,"You pay for what you get. Generally, cheaper policies have more restrictions on your cover. More expensive policies often offer better and wider cover with less restrictions. 

More restrictions mean you're less likely to have cover for what you want and end up without your claim being paid"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Genghis_Kong,3,"Yeah that's fair - not sure why I was feeling so impassioned about this when I wrote it!

I was very unimpressed with the mortgage advisor provided by my estate agent last time but that's literally one guy so yeah, not fair to tar everyone based on that interaction.

Thanks for your very reasonable response and for talking me down from some slightly pointless internet ranting!"
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,Genghis_Kong,2,"Or if you're not confident arranging your own mortgage, go to London & Country. They're no-fee mortgage brokers who won't rip you off."
Home insurance quotes from mortgage advisor,WDayAdviser,2,"Haha no worries we all have those moments. Although I will say if there's ever going to be a bad egg adviser, chances are it will come from an estate agent team, so maybe there's some merit to your unfortunate opinion!"

Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,itallstartedwithapub,4,">it ~~seems advisable~~ is essential to have secured insurance on the exchange date.

It's only 3 days away now, but if the house burns down this weekend (or is damaged in the storms to complete ruin), you will be obliged to continue the purchase on Monday. Your lender may also withdraw the mortgage if they are informed, as the property will no longer be suitable security.

Really you should call your insurers and ask to amend the start date to today. I expect, given the proximity to completion, most people would probably risk it at this point."
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,MonkyfaceJoJo,3,"Check the terms of your new house insurance. Ours officially started on completion day, but our insurers covered us from the day of exchange as a bonus. Its was in small print. We got lucky."
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,BlazingDragonfly,2,"Ideally, you should have buildings insurance from exchange, as that's when you commit to purchasing the property. Your vendor should also keep their own insurance active until completion as the property hasn't changed hands until that point. Hopefully, no damage has occurred and you will be fine for a few days longer.

Your solicitor should really have advised you about this, ours asked for proof we were ready to action the policy before exchanging. A lot of people wouldn't be aware of it otherwise."
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,Subject-Blueberry-55,1,The team of my mortgage advisor set it up for us. We'll give them a call tomorrow as well. Thanks!
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,Subject-Blueberry-55,3,"Update: I've read the terms. It says in there that they'll cover from the exchange date as long as it doesn't exceed 90 days. Luckily, it is only 18 days between exchange and completion.  

Thank you so much u/monkyfaceJoJo for suggesting this."
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,Subject-Blueberry-55,2,Will definitely go through this tonight. Many thanks!
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,Subject-Blueberry-55,1,"I appreciate your reply. The recent strong wind and rain have us a bit on edge. Unsure of what we'll find when we pick up the keys.

The start date on your policy started on the exchange date?"
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,annedroiid,3,They should absolutely know better then. That clause is standard in all mortgages.
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,MonkyfaceJoJo,3,You’re welcome. That’s great news! It’s one less thing to worry about for you.
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,BlazingDragonfly,2,"Yes, it started from the date of exchange.

I know a lot of places have been suffering with the recent weather, any chance you can walk/drive past this weekend to see if it still looks good from the street?"
Home Insurance and Exchange Confusion,Subject-Blueberry-55,2,Thanks! We'll try to go there tomorrow. I hope all is well.

Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,xxnicknackxx,9,"Read the claims condition in your policy very carefully. It likely says that you must notify your insurer about damage to the building. 

It is true that wear and tear is usually excluded as an insured cause, but that's typically when maintenance is your responsibility. 

To give an example, if your house was struck by a road vehicle with faulty brakes, maintenance of those brakes wouldn't come in to it from your perspective. Impact by road vehicle is usually an insured peril. The proximate cause of the damage would be impact by road vehicle from the perspective of the policy. That the vehicle was poorly maintained wouldn't stop your loss being covered. The insurer would face a separate issue. If they could show that the vehicle brakes were not maintained, they could potentially sue the owner for negligence in order to recover what they had to pay you to fix the damage. At that point they may also offer to include in the claim your uninsured losses, for example the excess. 

So have a look at the claims condition and have a look at the cover around ingress of water. If damage caused by the water ingress is covered, it becomes your insurer's problem to put pressure on the neighbour. 

If you agreed to pay a £600 excess, then the excess will be due. However if the damage was caused by another party's negligence, which it seems to be, then you may get your excess back if the insurer recovers from the neighbour. 

If you don't tell your insurer and the damage gets worse, then they may have grounds to decline any future claim on the basis that you haven't abided by the claims condition. They may even be able to do something like cancel the policy, which can be a really big problem. 

Your premiums may increase as a result of having a claim. It's rarely as big an increase as people worry about and it's often significantly lower than the cost of rectifying the damage. Most insurers ask about claims in the past 3 or 5 years, so after a few years you don't need to disclose it (unlike a cancelled policy). 

I deal with commercial insurance so don't know a huge amount about consumer products like home insurance, but this is what I would be looking at."
Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,Rat-Soup-Eating-MF,2,"my in laws had an issue with damp rising from the concrete subfloor and this was eventually traced to a leak on the neighbours water supply, the In laws had their house repaired & dried out through their own insurance who went after the neighbours insurance for the costs - they even had their excess returned to them"
Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,TobyChan,6,"No point going through your insurance if you don’t have legal cover.  The only thing that will happen is they’ll log it as a claim… despite rejecting it immediately because disrepair isn’t covered.

Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,Mexijim,1,"Damn that gives me hope, thanks.

I wonder if insurers would do this without my legal cover in place? Or whether they would pursue costs on their own, as it’s their own expenditure they are claiming back. So many grey areas."
Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,xxnicknackxx,3,">No point going through your insurance if you don’t have legal cover. 

What makes you so sure of this? 

>disrepair isn’t covered.

How can you be expected to maintain your neighbour's roof? Neglecting your own maintenance is one thing which rightly isn't covered. If an external cause damages your own well maintained property, that is exactly why you buy insurance. 

>Your claim is against the neighbour

OP's claim is against their insurer, to whom they pay a premium in return for compensation for insured damage. OP needs to establish to what extent the damage they have suffered is insured on their policy. If the damage is covered, dealing with the neighbour is all the insurer's problem. 

Failing insurance, OP potentially has grounds to sue their neighbour for compensation for negligence, but why on earth would you do this yourself if you have insurance?"

Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,xxnicknackxx,2,"You shouldn't be out of pocket due to the negligence of someone else, but you absolutely can be, which is part of the point in insuring yourself. 

You can pursue the excess yourself via small claims. Although if your insurer isn't pursuing the neighbour to recover their loss, it tells you something about their assessment of prospects of success. 

One can never be sure but I think it would be fairly likely that your insurer would pursue the neighbour to recover their loss. This can be a fair while after they have dealt with your first party claim. You would come to know about this because they would pursue in your name and so they would let you know this is happening, which is usually the point at which they offer to include your uninsured losses in the claim against the negligent party."
Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,Rat-Soup-Eating-MF,2,"in our case the other party was insured and it never went to legal it was sorted between themselves as insurance companies and the neighbours had to pay their  excess, in-laws paid theirs but eventually got it back - can’t say it didn’t  impact their premiums tho"
Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,xxnicknackxx,2,"This is nothing to do with legal cover. 

The insurer is obliged to compensate the policyholder for insured losses by virtue of the contract of insurance. 

The insurer has a separate duty to it's shareholders to minimise losses, so will pursue recovery where they deem it feasible. They will do this in the name of the policyholder, which is part of what the policyholder agrees when they buy the contract."

Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,xxnicknackxx,3,"Trying to recover 10k via the small claims court when you have insurance in place is bonkers. This stuff is literally why you buy insurance. 

It is common that people think that notifying insurers is optional. Usually it isn't and you are obliged to notify them of any insured damage. 

1 - what does the policy say about damage caused by water ingress? Is it covered?

2 - does the claims condition oblige you to notify the insurer of insured damage?

If the answer to both of these is yes, then you have no choice and should act accordingly, or you'll be in breach of contract. 

The excess usually comes out of what the insurance pays to compensate you. If there is £1,000 of insured damage, the insurer will pay you £400 to settle the claim, having deducted the £600 excess. 

Your contract with your insurer entitles you to claim from them for insured damage to your property. The same contract allows them to recover what they have to pay you from someone who was negligent and caused the damage. They do that by suing the negligent party in your name, if they can sue them. They may not be able to, but that isn't your problem. Your only concern is if the damage suffered is insured. If it is, then recovery etc. is all the insurer's problem. 

Legal expenses insurance is widely misunderstood. It gives quite limited cover for very specific matters and I don't think this would be one of those matters. If in doubt, read the policy."
Anybody ever claimed on home insurance for an issue with a neighbours leaking roof?,TheFirstMinister,2,"JFC - your neighbor is a cunt.  I hate him already.

I had something similar with my neighbor where one of his swimming pool pipes had cracked and were slowly leaking water into my back yard.  He denied it.  And denied it.  

I had a new French Drain installed but still the problem persisted because the root cause wasn't addressed.  Finally I went digging with my landscape guy and after 4 hours scooping out clay, mud and turf, we found the source of the leak.

Even when confronted with 4K video of water trickling from his pipe my cunt of a neighbor still denied anything was wrong.  I lost it completely and if my landscape guy was not there to hold me back I swear I'd have drowned my neighbor in his shitty pool.  I could not believe what I was hearing and that he had the gall to say, with a straight face, ""*I do not see any water leaking*"".  JFC - even typing this makes my blood pressure rise.

Anyway...now that I have gotten this out of my system - I sympathize.  Some neighbors can be wonderful. Some are absolute cunts and deserve to be on the receiving end of some ""nervous energy"".  I hope you get your issues resolved quickly."

I recommend you instruct a specialist roofing contractor."" or ""the couple buying the house seem very much in love, though relationships are prone to breakdowns and there is evidence of historic arguments.

I've had quotes from 120 up to 800. Looking through a lot of them there are very big differences in what is included (legal cover, accidental, emergency etc) and then also just who the provider is, I've found some great quotes for 230ish but upon reading reviews, I'm not going near them.

I think I've settled at being happy around 340ish with Aviva which has all the extras ticked! Still not 100% committed to them so my weekend is going to be spend doing one final review reading all the small prints to pin point the one I'll go for."
Approx home insurance cost?,Big_Target_1405,1,"3 bed in London here. Renewal was £600+ up from £450 a year ago.

This was with shopping around. Renewal quote was almost £800"

Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,[deleted],2,"It's buildings insurance. You don't need the contents until the house actually has your stuff in it and indeed you can't be insured until it is.  Check with your solicitor. Since I don't think you will be paying the service charge before completion, you might need/want a couple weeks of buildings cover (your lender would usually require it), but your solicitor will know.  Don't rely on them to bring it up- you can check with one quick phone call.

If the boiler breaks before you move in, then unfortunately, you'd just need to get it fixed. Try not to fret about it though. You can't control things that closely.  You could visit at 3pm the day before completion and it might still break at 4.30."
Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,raininfordays,1,"It's building insurance not contents as you don't own the existing contents. Also you don't legally own the building yet either - you've just commited to buying it from exchange regardless so your insurance covers anything that happens between exchange and completion at which point a regular policy should start.

If something big were to happen you'd go through your insurance. If the seller is insured, the ins co would try to get them to pay but they're not required to be insured at that point and/or may not have the level of cover needed. Either way, it's for your insurance to sort (so make sure you get a good policy). If it's small things usually you'd just eat the cost and fix/replace as the claim would end up costing more."
Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,the_reptile_house,1,"If you're getting any of the existing contents with the sale (e.g. you mention carpets) and you are worried about possible damage then you could get contents insurance. You don't have to do this though, and it might be expensive with you not living there during the two weeks."

"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Top_Mortgage_9383,7,"I’m in the same boat and I’m very confused! 
I don’t know what lock types are on the doors and windows and I don’t know if there are any smoke alarms. Am I supposed to take out just buildings insurance or contents too? Or am I supposed to add contents after completion? Eagerly awaiting some expert advice! 😄"
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",jarry1250,8,"1. Always take cover out from exchange
2. You only need Buildings Cover (this is a mortgage requirement) not contents cover. You may be able to switch your existing contents cover to your new property.
3. Refer to the Property Information Form for info
4. Notify your insurer if the property will be vacant (if it exceeds the 14 or 28 days specified in your policy)"
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",dinosaursrarr,4,You just take out a policy as if you do live there. It's normal and you'll be living there soon enough.
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",[deleted],2,"I have a feeling when I did it I needed to have a basic policy for buildings in place when I exchanged and the solicitor said the lender would need to see proof of that on completion day before they would release the funds. I just took a basic building insurance policy out they didn’t ask me about lock types it was the construction, roof, subsidence and I just put the completion date as when it was starting. It was 12 years ago though so maybe it’s not as easy these days. Another reason why I’m never moving again!"
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",[deleted],-4,[deleted]
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Future_Direction5174,1,"Ask the vendors who their policy is with - then contact that company, explain that you wish to arrange Buildings Insurance cover from the date of exchange of contracts. The people who currently insure the property should already have all the information they need - although you have to assume that the vendors were trueful when they took out the cover.

That is what we did when we bought our house. It was insured as “vacant” anyway."
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",egrebaf,3,"You will need Buildings insurance only at the point of exchange. Your insurer should then quote you for contents insurance from the point of completion until your renewal date. Unless the insurer is very picky about the types of lock, you should be able to get a quote at their lowest security level and just update details once you have them."
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Bethbeth35,2,Glad I'm not the only one! Flummoxed
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",[deleted],2,"It's best practice to do a final viewing just before exchange to check the house is still in good condition before you're committed to buying it. At this point, you should check the locks and smoke alarms etc and fill those answers in ready for the insurance to start from the day of exchange"
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Bethbeth35,1,"Still no clearer for me, I'm going to try and speak to another one tomorrow morning. We tried Hastings earlier and I'm not convinced they understood what I was talking about and their website included us agreeing that only the policy holders would be living at the property (as did another one I got a quote from), which sounds a bit like something which could void the policy for the period we're talking about doesn't it! 
Clear as mud."
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Bethbeth35,1,And what if in that time the property is still inhabited by the current owners? We almost bought the policy today but then it makes you agree that only the policy holders will be living in the property. We've got four weeks where we will not be the ones living in the property.
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Bethbeth35,4,"From what I've read you're actually legally responsible for the house before you even move in, as soon as you exchange contracts basically so that's when the insurance needs to start."
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Agreeable_Guard_7229,3,"The policy needs to start from the date of exchange, not completion.

Once you’ve exchanged you have committed to buy the property for the agreed price.

If the property was to burn down between exchange and completion and it wasn’t insured, then you would still have to pay the seller the agreed amount regardless of the fact the house has burned down"
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Top_Mortgage_9383,3,Good luck! Hope they can clarify things. Given every person who buys a house has to do this you’d think they’d make it clearer on their websites!
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",jarry1250,2,"Yes, take out the policy. I've been through Axa before and they're clear about this - it doesn't matter if you haven't moved on yet."
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Bethbeth35,2,"Just taken a policy with Admiral, they're well rated on Trust pilot and the person I spoke to did ask about the completion date and confirm we were covered from today. Frustrating that there's nothing really in writing confirming the coverage is valid despite not being the current occupiers but this is the best I could do, every insurer you call is people reading from scripts. Annoying."
"Home insurance prior to completion, confused!",Top_Mortgage_9383,1,I’m glad your sorted! I actually work for an insurance broker so you’d think I’d be clued up on this kind of thing!! 😄

Home insurance recommendations?,itallstartedwithapub,3,Head to your favourite comparison site and pick the cheapest which is suitable for your needs.
Home insurance recommendations?,Cardboard_rocks,3,"As someone who was recently burgled and had to make a claim, I would also recommend LV. They were fantastic, no quibbles, easy system. Was fully paid out new for old. 

I could perhaps have gotten cheaper insurance but when I needed it, I'm glad I went with them and it was worth the money."
Home insurance recommendations?,fluffbabies,3,"Just took out home and contents with Direct Line. They have home or home plus. In the end we went with plus because it wasn’t much more expensive for what we wanted and offered a lot more for that extra. Was also the cheapest out of the 5/6 I compared. Most insurers seem to have 2-3 different levels of cover. Make sure you check what is covered so you can get what you need but also you might pay for things you don’t need. 

I think it was Which that compared a lot and recommended the following ones: NFU Mutual, Direct Line, LV, Aviva and Axa if I’m remembering correctly. I found Aviva’s quote was extortionate for us, double the average of the others. LV was about £50 more expensive over the year and the cover amounts were less. 

The cost will depend on your individual situation of course but I would go on comparison websites and look at the cheapest couple of big name insurers  you’ve heard of. Also go on direct line’s website and get a quote as they’re not on the comparison sites. 

Try and compare like for like. Then go to those 2 or 3’s websites and check the details of the quote and have a look at their policy documents. 

It took me a couple of days to figure out what to get. It’s not as straight forward or quick as car insurance so give yourself time. I took it out today on the day of exchange and was quite stressed at how long it was taking!"
Home insurance recommendations?,fluffbabies,2,"Just to add.. some policies will look cheaper especially on the comparison websites but when you go and look on their website you’ll find differences like something that was included in another you have to pay extra for with that one. Or that cheaper one covers you for £2500 outside the home but you need £5000, and the more expensive one included £5000 as standard. 

You get the idea lol. 

Another tip: get the quote emailed to you/make an account to save it/take down the reference number/screenshot it to keep it somehow. Quotes change daily but once you have one it’s usually valid for a month. 

When I went to take out mine today after two days of looking and I had to put the details in again, it had gone from £388 to £475! Undoing my comparing. Could have cried! I have them a call and they found my old quote and I had the email to back it up if they couldn’t see it they said I could send it to them. The lady was amazing, answered all my questions and I was covered. Takes 1-2 days to get policy by email. She reassured me and immediately sent me a document to give to my solicitor and lender today. I got it in under an hour."
Home insurance recommendations?,Born_Eagle_2488,4,Thank you so much for all those details. Really helpful and much appreciated. I’m going to Direct Line now and then comparison websites!
Home insurance recommendations?,fluffbabies,2,"No worries at all. It’s such a steep learning curve!  


Basically if you find your premium jumps up really high when you’ve added something, see if its included in the next cover level as standard while costing less. Or check the similar level of cover with a different insurer.   


If it’s something like you have a lot of expensive tech or bikes, you may be better of going up a level or not including it and looking at specialist insurance like for e-bikes that give more cover and are cheaper. I have an expensive laptop and we would like to get e-bikes in the future so had to experiment more. If your home and contents are pretty standard it’s a lot more straightforward.   


Good luck In your search!  If you need any help feel free to ask."
Home insurance recommendations?,Born_Eagle_2488,1,Thank you so much again 😊 I’ve went through direct line and compared it with LV from mortgage advisor. Direct line won the offer so I will go for it!

Home insurers claim house is a flood risk - Environment Agency does not,Ok-Warning-5111,2,"Source: I work in pricing Home insurance and am procrastinating.

There are a number of sources that insurers use for flood risk pricing, but the EA data is rarely used as a dominant source. In the UK the leading provider of flood data is JBA, I don’t believe you’ll be able to directly access their view of your flood risk. The maps and scores they produce are similar to EA data but many properties will see different results from the nuanced differences in the underlying flood modelling assumptions.

The larger insurers tend to price this risk at the property level, though some will price for the highest risk within each postcode (which is likely problematic for you). Usually When pricing at property level a buffer of 5m/10m/15m is used around the post office’s address point. Some insurers may be able to assess the highest flood risk within a property’s footprint.

Naturally insurers charge more where flood risk is modelled as high, but beyond this every insurer will set their own flood appetite - eg what level of risk they’re prepared to accept regardless of the cost. If you have a medium/high flood risk according to the data, you may be below some insurers thresholds, and above others.

Some insurers also use ancillary data - eg they might have prior experience of nearby properties having flooded and wish to be cautious.

More generally, it may be that your property is at risk of surface water flooding rather than river flooding. Eg it’s not the risk of the river breaking its banks and reaching you, rather the excess water from extreme rainfall is expected to collect near your property before flowing into the nearby river.

The reality is you’ll continue to have limited options. Insurers may change their appetite from time to time which could lead to slight changes in who will quote for you. Also their flood models and the external data can occasionally change, especially if your property is one of the less credible predictions (eg modelled at the edge of a potential flood extent).

Many insurers will have a higher threshold for their direct business so it’s worth calling a few up (as you have done). Unfortunately insurers tend to price their direct business less keenly!"

Home insurers claim house is a flood risk - Environment Agency does not,sargant,1,Postcode is exclusively for this small estate built in 2012.

Yeah I agree makes sense to keep old insurance in place in case something goes wrong or we don't move in the end.

So new policy for the new property, would I still put the years no claims I have on the new policy even with another running along side?

(historic) Premium Home Insurance for new owners question,Grouchy-Nobody3398,2,"Are you looking for buildings and contents insurance, or just contents insurance?

&#x200B;

It is correct the building(or estate) as a whole will likely have a higher premium due to a historic claim (as with any property) and this should have been disclosed during your solicitors enquiries and the reports they passed over to you so you could investigate before finalising the purchase."

Home Insurance - Any tips?,Esmay89,3,"I think a lot of them are pretty similar unless you have specific requirements or a non-standard property. Most of the well known providers will have a defacto 5 star rating, will cover similar things as standard, and will have 1,000's of unhappy customer reviews alongside some positive ones.

I'm pretty analytical, so ""just pick one"" didn't sit well with me. So I downloaded the key policy docs for the 3 cheapest quotes and compared the key points I cared most about. I found Admiral Platinum had the higher limits on the things I cared about, was the cheapest   
 Buildings, Contents and Accidental damage policy and were less strict about some of the information I would need to provide (i.e. they don't seem to care about flat roof percentage, and ours is quite high due to several dormers and an extension). They are part of the FloodRe scheme you mentioned, although we're on top of a large hill, noah's arc will be underwater before us, so not something I personally investigated.

I'm sure someone will say ""don't use Admiral, they are the worst, they did X to us"", but someone will say the same about every insurer. I've only had to claim through them once (car insurance) and it was fairly painless with no issues, filled in a few bits of paper, got a courtesy car whilst mine was being repaired, just went about with my life as normal. So anecdotally, I only have positive things to say about them at the moment.

I'm aware this reply is quite pro-Admiral, so just for balance... Do your own research and make your own decision. I'm just 1 person, who has been happy with their service in the past and has fortunately never had to claim through any other insurer to compare them directly when it matters most."
Home Insurance - Any tips?,nzara001,1,"Directline and Churchill are operated by the same company, so the “good service” is exactly the same, but churchill is usually cheaper and on PCW"
Home Insurance - Any tips?,CarlBassett,1,"I've only ever made a couple of claims and both times they paid out without any fuss. When it come to making a claim don't try to take the piss and they'll probably pay it. Make a huge claim that's clearly over the top and they'll start pushing back and find a reason to reject it.      
When getting a quote don't try to be sneaky to save a few pounds. If you have a three bed house but use one as an office don't tell them it's a two bed house to get a lower deal. If you ever make a claim they can use that to reject your entire claim."

Home insurance - is concrete tile concrete or tile?,Donny-Kong,1,"Going slightly against the grain here but are you using a comparison site? If so I’d call the company that you’re thinking of going with and speak to them directly. The comparison sites don’t match up and sometimes populate incorrectly with the wrong information. Insurance companies also have different classification and to me a concrete roof and concrete tiles are 2 different things, behave differently and cost different amounts to repair/replace. On Victorian houses the black tiles in some instances are engineered concrete and not slate, some will consider this as a slate style tile and not a concrete tile. When you’re fitting a velux window and buying the fitting kit you would buy a slate kit and not a tile kit. 

Bottom line it’s not about the £20 but you being insured properly hence why the answer has turned so long winded."

Keep home insurance after exchange?,PayApprehensive6181,2,"Maybe get a quote from them to see what the price would be to change properties from your completion date.

You never know if might be cheaper that the new policy you purchased. In which case you can use the 14 day cooling period to cancel the current on and see if your current insurer is able to transition from the current to the new seamlessly whilst saving you money.

Just call and explain your circumstances and see if they are able to give you a better deal; otherwise you can just choose not to renew. Not worth cancelling as it probably won't be cost effective"

Questions about home insurance.,FionaTheHobbit,6,"As a previous household insurance underwriter - deffo don't just insure part of your contents. If it turns out at point of claim that you were underinsured, your claim can get reduced by the % difference it would have made to your insurance premium. (Back in the day it used to be proportional to the amount by which you are underinsured, but it changed a few years ago due to FCA) 

There's some checklists online which might help you make sure you're not forgetting anything, for example:  https://www.confused.com/home-insurance/contents-calculator

But also, a lot of policies these days will be written on a blanket sum insured basis - that is to say, you get a fixed contents sum insured, such as 50k or 100k, and the insurance company calculates the premium on what they think the contents might be (based on the type of property/number of bedrooms etc). May include a certain amount for valuables too but you'll obviously need to double check that.


Otherwise, premium will be influenced by factors such as:  

- claims history (and conversely, no claims discount - if it's your first year on risk this will be nil but could go up to roughly 20-30% or so if I remember well), 

- voluntary excess (other than the £ saving insurers make by you not claiming for small things, you're signaling that you're not interested in making spurious claims) - note the voluntary excess will apply over and above the compulsory excess and any peril specific excesses (eg flood or escape of water)

- whether or not you choose to have accidental damage included (usually quite a high load for it on the contents side, unless you've got a more ""premium"" kind of policy and it's included as standard, but then the base premium will be higher), 

- area (for theft & flood on the contents side, and also for subsidence on the buildings side) 



One other thing to note is, for ""personal possessions"" it makes a difference whether you're insuring them in the home only, or also away from the home - latter being more expensive. Managed to save my boyfriend a few pennies a few years ago when I amended his gaming PC to ""in home only"" - for whatever reason it had been rated as an ""away from home"" personal possession, which is a bit silly for a big desktop PC weighing 10kg or so!

Righty, enough insurance nerd-age from me :))"
Questions about home insurance.,itallstartedwithapub,3,"Size of cover generally doesn't make much difference to the cost. The cost is influenced more on your chosen excess, optional extras like legal cover, previous claims, high value items and your address."
Questions about home insurance.,flying_pingu,3,"Assume you have to buy absolutely everything again from scratch. Clothes, towels, bedding, all your furniture, all your soft furnishings, all your cooking equipment, kitchen equipment, glasses, cutlery etc etc. I think we went with 50K contents but I'll probably up it again when we move into a house."
Questions about home insurance.,gardenpea,1,"I found out, rather to my surprise, that not one of the normal insurers on compare the market would touch me with a bargepole. Literally no one. 

This was due to a combination of me 

(a) being self employed and planning to use the business for some aspects of the business (no visitors and nothing particularly dangerous; weirdly one insurer would have been fine with me using one room but declined to quote anyone using 2)

(B) planning some building works. It turns out insurers think putting in a new kitchen is structural. 

(C) not moving in immediately, even though I was visiting several times a day

In the end I went with a specialist broker called Certis, but it cost about double what it would have cost if I were a straightforward customer, and I could really have done without the stress - it delayed exchange by a few days."
Questions about home insurance.,OdBlow,1,"Might be worth getting a quote then taking it to your car insurer if you have one.

Questions about home insurance.,Heewna,1,"Hey, can I jump on this to ask. Last year I had a life insurance (critical illness) policy refuse to pay out and cancelled on me. I had to disclose that next time I applied for car insurance and it put my premiums through the roof. I’m currently fighting with the life insurance company via the ombudsman, but in your experience am I likely to have problems obtaining household insurance because of having had a previous insurance policy cancelled?"
Questions about home insurance.,Natural-Ingenuity538,1,"Ah on that makes sense. So typically better off covering everything you can for the sake of a few quid.

!thanks"
Questions about home insurance.,FionaTheHobbit,1,"You're welcome, glad my insurance nerdiness could be helpful! Generally, it's worth reviewing the actual policy wording for the insurance you're thinking of getting - if you look at a couple, you'll start to get a feel for what terms are ""standard"" and what's worth shopping around for better terms. Also, Defaqto ratings can give you a quick & easy overview of how broad the scope of cover is. Moreover, if you're trying to compare providers, it's useful to look out in the reviews for how helpful they are at point of claim, it's what you pay them for! 

Good luck, and enjoy your new house! :)"
Questions about home insurance.,FionaTheHobbit,2,"Sorry to hear you're having to go through that, sounds super stressful! But yeah, sadly, you'll have to disclose any previously cancelled insurance - at this point, some providers may straight off decline, some will ask additional questions to find out more about your circumstances. If it sounds like you were the innocent party and didn't purposefully/maliciously withhold any information (ombudsman agreeing with you will go a long way to proving that), they may be ok with it. It's probably worth contacting a broker who will have a better idea as to which insurers are likely to be most helpful."
Questions about home insurance.,Heewna,1,"Thank you, yeah it’s been pretty awful on top of having had cancer! I’m guessing if I’m buying with my partner I can’t just put it in their name, or I’d run the risk of it being cancelled again. Best I can hope for is to use a company like that add a time constraint like “in the last five years have you had insurance cancelled” and just wait for six years. Hopefully it won’t jeopardise getting at mortgage at all :("

"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",jacekowski,36,"Other comment is incorrect, legally it's not your problem, person below is liable for the costs. Decision to be made here depends only on what sort of relationship you want to have with your neighbours."
"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",Low_Action_1068,13,"We had a similar leak from the flat above. The landlord of the flat above fixed the leak, and we claimed through the buildings insurance for the damage to our flat. The buildings insurance was arranged by the management company, and all leaseholders of all the flats pay a share of the premium (including both ourselves as resident leaseholders and the landlord of the flat above).

There was never any question of the owner (leaseholder/landlord) of the flat above paying directly for the damage to our flat - that was the job of our communal buildings insurance.

Do you not also have a similar arrangement - insurance arranged by the management company for the building and shared between all leaseholders?  I do believe some management companies include the buildings insurance in the service charge, but ours was billed separately. We could get a copy of the certificate on request."
"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",scraxeman,8,"I think at this point I would be writing a short, factual letter to the owner of the flat below stating (a) the time at which you were informed of the leak, (b) the time at which the leak was fixed, and (c) the details of your home insurance and the management company's building insurance. If you have any claim reference numbers, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't share them, along with any (factual) instructions that you have received from the insurance companies.

Don't admit liability, just state facts.

After that, I would say it's the flat owner's problem to work out how to recover her losses -- you can make helpful noises, but it's not really your problem. Her best bet is probably the buildings insurance."
"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",Andy_Bear_,5,"It's amazing how some landlords are both useless (in grasping how to handle basic issues in running a home and how to communicate clearly with their tenants) while also having a difficult manner. They do rather deserve the problems they create for themselves. I wonder if this one also failed to lodge the tenant'a deposit with one of the three protection schemes – if so, this will give the tenant some leverage (and he should raise the matter on Reddit rather than educate the landlord)."
"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",daveonhols,2,"I had a similar ish situation once. Basically there is a difference between a leak from a pipe in a communal part of the building, and a leak from a pipe in your flat. In your case it seems like the latter, which I believe actually means the building insurance won't cover it. I don't actually know the correct course of action but I would lean more towards your insurance covering it possibly by her insurance company claiming against them, which is complicated by her not having insurance."

I sent the landlord Citizens Advice articles stating this but is pretty insistent it’s my responsibility to fix/pay for fixing her flat. Hopefully the building insurance will pay up for her. I’d even offer to pay a portion of the costs if not covered but she’s definitely wanting me to foot the whole thing.
"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",FinalRecording3233,3,"Thanks for the info.

Yes I have a similar set up as you with the building insurance, it’s in with our usual service charge payments. However initially my management company agreed with the landlord and said I would be liable to pay out of pocket for the damage in her flat, but after I challenged this they did pass on the building insurance details for me to contact to check and see if this scenario would be covered. I have opened a claim with them but they told me the landlord should really be going through her landlord insurance initially and then her insurance could claim through the building insurance? They recommended this as they said their claims can take weeks to settle, and they only pay out instead of providing builders etc., whereas if she went through her home insurance they’d send someone out to fix the flat as soon as possible. But as of today I found out she has no home insurance, but has paid to get builders in to fix the flat, so would I be right in thinking the building insurance would just pay out to her directly?"
"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",FinalRecording3233,1,"After the first day I wrote her a message similar to what you’ve suggested but more informal. I will definitely be doing this, thank you - I appreciate the advice."

"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",Portas30k,8,I'd probably stop communicating with her. You've provided all the info you need to and if her insurance company (which she doesn't have) deems you liable the can pursue you.
"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",grahamthegoldfish,2,"I think what is being misunderstood here is really how insurance works. Your insurance covers you against losses you incur regardless of fault. You haven't personally incurred a loss here, your neighbour has. They claim on their insurance for the loss. Their insurance may pursue your insurance company to cover those costs if they believe there's a case.

Replace the house insurance with car insurance and it makes more sense. Let's say your brakes fail and you crash into another car as a result.  Both parties will claim off of their own insurance. The non fault party will reclaim the cost from the insurance of the at fault party. You wouldn't expect to pay directly for the damage.

Having said all of that I think your neighbour has a weak case. Insurance will require you to take reasonable action to mitigate problems before they're are catastrophic.  In this case they saw a problem and ignored it for days. That's the reason that there is significant damage and they are responsible for that IMO. If they have taken reasonable action the damage would have been limited to drying out the ceiling and perhaps fixing some water stains, neither of which I think would be significant enough to trouble insurance for."
"Landlord has no home insurance. Leak unknown to me caused damage to the landlord’s flat below, am I liable?",Low_Action_1068,1,"Yes, I believe so. As far as I remember, we arranged and paid for the painting and plastering work, and then the buildings insurance settled our claim minus some excess (£100 I think). I spoke to the management company to understand the process and whether they or the insurer needed to see quotes before the work went ahead - I can't remember whether they did, as this was about 10 years ago!

Anyway, this is for the landlord of the flat below to figure out - she should be talking to the management company and working out how to make a claim against the buildings insurance. I'd leave it to her. The key thing is that you acted to stop and fix the leak as soon as you were aware, and that's where your responsibility ends. You can't reasonably be held responsible for a leak in pipework hidden under a floor, as if you were supposed to regularly inspect and maintain it. This is just the sort of incident that buildings insurance is supposed to cover."

Do you pay for home insurance Extras like legal cover or accidental damage cover?,[deleted],5,"This perspective is as someone who had to claim twice for burglary and now as an ex insurance broker who knows how it works.

I'd always take legal cover. I'd always take accidental damage for buildings as a simple accident can be thousands to fix. I'd never take accidental for contents as claims are comparatively small but cause a disproportionate increase in premiums if you claim for everything or often; basically I would only claim for contents for major risks like fire and flood.

I've taken home emergency cover before but the details of some policies are appalling and just don't bother with it now. I think about it like this; why pay for something to get a makeshift fix done free when the insurer is going to have to repair it anyway."
Do you pay for home insurance Extras like legal cover or accidental damage cover?,TheFirstMinister,3,"Remember that insurance only pays out when one of the documented (in the policy) insured perils has been ""invoked"".

And just because you can claim for an insured event doesn't mean you should. Sometimes paying out of pocket is the more financially prudent decision.

Years ago I worked in a buildings insurance claims division. My favorite ""case"" was from a guy who was attempting to claim for a pair of spectacles. I remember it like it was yesterday and in the description of the claim he wrote, 

""My pet magpie stole my glasses and they're in his nest in my back garden. He has previously stolen my watch and other jewelry"".

In my experience, you don’t usually need to provide the survey as part of the claims process. They might ask questions if the claim looks like it might have been going on pre-inception, but there’s a decent chance they’ll just send a surveyor out to confirm if it’s an insurable peril."
Do you pay for home insurance Extras like legal cover or accidental damage cover?,OwlBebula,1,"I was actually searching reddit for the exact same thing. Funny this came up just now!

I'm currently thinking of going down the path of having the extras but without legal cover as that seems to add a fair bit 20GBP to the yearly premium and I'm trying to keep under 400GBP a year for a 2 bed semi. 

The main thing I've been discussing with my Broker and other people is that while I can easily find some providers for even 200GBP with all these things included it seems to realy be about the quality of the provider in general, their payout rates, how fast are they to answer and help etc etc

This is where I am finding the biggest struggle, naturally the broker has vendors they'd prefer to use but additionally the specific person I am in discussions with is very honest and it's really that you get what you pay for. 

One of the biggest examples of this I can use an example is the Solicitors for my FTB which is in process like yours, I found quotes for very cheap but decided to go for some pretty pricey lawyers but they have been absoluelty outstanding and I think I get replies within minutes of any question I have or any updates, they have a brilliant app that has a live status of whats being worked on I do alot of the paper work in the app. Where as friends of mine who went the other way said it was painful. 

I had the same deliberations with Life Insurance, Income protection, Critical Illness cover as to even if I need all three. (I really wish this was discussed at a school or uni level) As I never even thought about these until my broker spoke to me about them. 

I'm not sure I really have an answer for you other than I'm having the same problem as you. Trying to squeeze as much as I can in to not get fucked when something goes wrong but also just spent my whole paycheck on insurances haha."

Don't forget a broker is a salesperson at the end of the day.

Interested to know how you’re assessing the suitability of insurers, is this just on the advice of your broker or did you find a good resource? I’m always a bit dubious about online customer reviews. 

My broker also wanted to me to take out life/income/critical illness cover but I decided against all of them. But this is mainly as I get fairly good cover from work and have no dependents so the risk vs the quite high monthly payments so just didn’t balance out for me, but I’m sure they do for many others."

They are my mortgage broker and they have in-house like insurance and home insurance specialists.  So I've been speaking with them individually. 

Totally argree on the point about them being a sales person. It's why I'm spending extra time on evaluating their off which they claim is a better supplier (easier to work with to make claims, short wait times etc). 

&#x200B;

>What extras are you getting for twice the price? Or are you in a risky/floody area or something?

From what I can see on the quote accidental, home emergency and legal cover. They also have pretty low voluntary and compulsory excess's some of the compulsory ones are half of what some of the big providers are.

But the 400GBP is really what got me questioning the suggestion from the broker so trying to do as much reading of the IPID as I can to see if there truly is a benefit to the extra. Also this evening planning on looking at the reviews online a bit more."
Do you pay for home insurance Extras like legal cover or accidental damage cover?,OwlBebula,1,"In terms of what I am doing to compare the providers I am trying to find all their IPID documents. This should go into a fair bit of detail about what is and isnt covered.

Some of the key ones that vary for example are tracing and accessing leaks, some may find and stop the leak butt thats it, while others will repair damage caused by the leak (IE if if then leaked downstairs and ruined your wall).

Another one I've been looking at is the compulsory excess's as they do seem to vary. Some are like 1000GBP for a leak whereas others are 250, then there are rather large, differences for theft some will have a minimum that you need to declare 1,500 or more whereas some are 4,000 or over.

So really I am trying to find the provider who looks like they cover the most in terms of it anything goes wrong, has good reviews, a good defaqto start rating, has all the extras and in somewhere from 250 to 350.

Just it's a lot of legwork, I should have done the same for my Life, Income and Critical illness insurance but it all came out to like 80GBP a month which I had budgeted for anyway so felt it was fair especially as the price is now locked in for life.  

&#x200B;

But as someone else mentioned, I am taking my brokers suggestion with a big grain of salt until I work out if the quote is actually decent or not... which is what I will now be doing after work haha"
Do you pay for home insurance Extras like legal cover or accidental damage cover?,Ok_Pumpkin9588,1,"These are really useful points to look up in policies, thanks for sharing. 

I've been very thorough in my research with regards to the main ""product"" I'm buying ie. the house itself (its structure and upkeep, the various survey results, maintenance and getting trader quotes ). and that has been incredibly time consuming. I'm also onto my second house in 5 months as well since the first one fell through. 

So I just hadn't had the time to look into insurance policies very much although I usually like to do my research. I think I'm just going to grab the insurance products that seem to broadly make the most sense this time around and when it comes to renewing in a year's time, I'll do more research. Of course this might turn out to be a bad approach as I don't really know all the problems of the house yet (despite all the surveys) and so many things could break in the first year. So in fact I might do a bit more research inspired by your example... I found out today that we have yet another delay in the run up to exchange so I have the time now 🙄"

Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,Ultrasonic-Sawyer,13,"By unoccupied, I would often interpret that as ""sat completely empty of humans 24/7"", like if you went on holiday.


So builders coming and going, or yourself coming to do works on the weekend and pottering off would, in my opinion, consider it occupied even if for a few hours a week.



My logic being that from their perspective, they just don't want you leaving it empty and coming back to find the water pipes burst, gas main is leaking, floors caved in, a meth lab has setup upstairs, and a gang of roving ferrets now call your loft home.


So, in my view (and take it with a pinch of salt as I could be wrong), so long as somebody goes in and checks its all in one piece, taps work, no leaks, and other stuff, then it should be fine."

However - you will also probably find that your insurance company need to be notified of any substantial works to the insured property, and that they may want to review your cover / increase price as a result.  We've just had a bunch of structural walls taken out and notified Admiral, who wanted to charge us a relatively small extra amount on the policy to continue cover during the works.

Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,richyicthan,1,Don't forget you also have to tell insurers you're planning these works as it may invalidate your policy as many have endorsements
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,SpinnakerLad,2,"> So builders coming and going, or yourself coming to do works on the weekend and pottering off would, in my opinion, consider it occupied even if for a few hours a week.

What matters is the insurers definition, they may well not include a property under renovation as 'occupied' if no one is living in it. For example I had a policy once that defined occupied as furnished as well as you sleeping there multiple nights a week as well as doing day to day living (washing, cooking, working etc not just turning up to sleep there).

The best thing to do is to call insurers and ask about suitable policies."
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,alperton,3,This is exactly what I am doing. I'm going in and out while works still carrying on. Just not staying over.
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,itravelforchurros,1,How much are your works coming in at?
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,Ultrasonic-Sawyer,1,That's a fair point and I do agree.
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,SpinnakerLad,2,"As I mentioned in another comment you should really check what your policy says the definition of 'occupied' is. If no one's sleeping there for instance, you may not meet it."
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,[deleted],1,[deleted]
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,alperton,2,"There is a sofa bed in the property, do they really but really need to know though? When I was applying for the insurance, insurer asked me if I want to cancel my current contents policy, I said I would like to keep it till end of it. He was curios how can I be at two places at the same time. Now this can be answered easily by a quantum physicists but I simply replied as I will be staying over there while working on renovations and my other half will be staying at our current place. Which is half true."
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,itravelforchurros,1,How much? Only asking as we're trying to do similar
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,SpinnakerLad,2,">There is a sofa bed in the property, do they really but really need to know though?

I don't know, check your policy.

If you have a minor claim it likely won't matter.

If say the whole property burns down I would expect they'll discover it was undergoing renovation and you weren't living there at the time. You wouldn't want them to declare the whole policy invalid or get away with a reduced payout."
Home insurance - Renovation after purchase of home advice.,Tnpenguin717,1,"This is the very best understanding here... Probably simplified under one rule:

You pays your money and take your chance not telling them, however if tits go spectacularly up the insurance could easily find out you have not adhered to the insurance policies and you could not be covered. This is all about risk management regarding ""chance of x risk occurring"" vs ""severity of outcome is x risk occurs""."

Moving home soon but home insurance about to renew,Sad_Researcher_5299,5,You’ll need insurance on the new place anyway so why not just change the address on the policy when you move? Most providers are fine with this.
Moving home soon but home insurance about to renew,sallystarling,3,"I had a similar situation. I think all insurance lets you cancel and (if you pay annually) refunds the unused proportion. All the ones I looked at did anyway. Instead of renewing my existing policy, which had a cancellation fee, I let it expire and went on a comparison site and picked a new one that didn't have cancellation fees. 

Separately I took out a new policy for the new house (valid from exchange), as I needed buildings plus contents for that and only contents for my old (rented) house. Then when I moved in I just cancelled the policy I'd taken out on the old house and got most of it back as I'd only used it for a few weeks."
Moving home soon but home insurance about to renew,itallstartedwithapub,2,Cancel it when you move out and you'll get a partial refund minus an admin fee.
Moving home soon but home insurance about to renew,[deleted],5,Don't you need to insure from date of exchange? So you kinda need insurance on both places for a bit (unless you exchange and complete the same day)
Moving home soon but home insurance about to renew,dalehitchy,1,Oh right? I rang my current provider and he didn't suggest this.
Moving home soon but home insurance about to renew,Sad_Researcher_5299,3,"In that case just cancel the other policy. 
I’m not sure if it’s a rule vs just good practice but I’ve definitely been refunded for unused insurance periods before. One of those read the small print moments."

Flat roof inspection for home insurance,itallstartedwithapub,1,"You could look for an NFRC member, it would be hard for an insurer to argue they aren't qualified.

As you say the term 'qualified' is quite open to interpretation."

When is it appropriate to use home insurance?,WG47,2,"Depends how much damage there is, how much it'd cost you to set it right, how much your excess is, how much you expect your premium to rise by...

And of course if you're able to fix the damage yourself, you'll save a lot over getting someone in to do it.

These are questions only you can answer. I'm the kind of person who'd rather fix things myself. Even if it's a skill I don't have right now, learning it is useful for the future."
When is it appropriate to use home insurance?,treeseacar,2,"It depends on the cost. If the ceiling is coming down it's a big job for redecorating. If it's a long ongoing leak you might need to replace joists and floorboards.  The home insurance isn't going to increase as much as the repair bill. 

However if it's a minor leak it might be an easy fix and you don't need to bother claiming. Check what your excess is and what exactly you will be covered for."

As having insurance is a clause in the mortgage offer, if you were to break it your solicitor would be obligated to make them aware that you don't yet have the insurance. How the solicitors find out is a different question though. Most times they'll make you aware you need to get it out and that's that. They won't follow up or request docs. 

Even if they do in this case, the fact you have cover on it means there's no issue anymore. Don't worry about it."

How to pick the right home insurance ?,FinanceAddiction,3,Generally they're all fairly similar in terms of cover offered if your house is fairly big standard (no special construction methods etc) personally I use a comparison site such as Money Supermarket and the three best priced for the coverage I want I will go and look at reviews of the customer service experience.

How to pick the right home insurance ?,Unlikely_Concept5107,2,"Worked in insurance for years and my general advice to anyone who asks is go for the cheapest option of the names you’ve heard of and you won’t go far wrong.

Most if not all of the household names will be Defacto 5 rated."
How to pick the right home insurance ?,TheGoober87,1,"Use gocompare or comparethemarket and do a comparison.

Don't just go for the cheapest though, make sure you add all the bits you think you will need.

home insurance when buying a house,litfan35,16,"It won't affect your mortgage other than it may actually help you secure it if the lender checks again before releasing the funds - most mortgages require insurance to be in place as part of their terms, so they'll like seeing you've got it in place"
home insurance when buying a house,Artois55,4,"Just did this. I don't think the bank would take issue with this, however I didn't get the insurance until the exchange day. By that time the mortgage offer would have been made to you and your solicitor would be writing to your bank to get the money. So bank is not going to do another credit check at this point."
home insurance when buying a house,Curi0us_Yellow,1,"You’ll be fine. Your provider has most likely offered you the mortgage already if you’re on the verge of exchanging. You need to have insurance in place once you’ve exchanged, so that’s after the fact and they’d be stupid if they’re not considering that you’ll need to do that."
home insurance when buying a house,ex0-,8,Lenders don't have the ability to check to see if insurance is in place FWIW. It's just a requirement within the mortgage offer.
home insurance when buying a house,One-Customer951,3,That's great thank you! I tend to over think and plan for the worst so needed to double check!
home insurance when buying a house,[deleted],-2,"This is terrible advice.

Do not take out new credit after a mortgage application. Of any kind. Ever.

They may not check. They probably won't check, but if they do they'll potentially see another credit line that you haven't declared. Not worth the risk over something like an insurance policy.

Monthly insurance products are more often than not a line of credit that involve a hard search on your credit file."
home insurance when buying a house,One-Customer951,1,Thank you this is really helpful! Will get it sorted now ready for exchange
home insurance when buying a house,cattacos37,1,"Just curious, did you take it out in advance of the exchange date, but set the policy start date to be the date of exchange? Or did you literally take it out on the date of exchange?"
home insurance when buying a house,litfan35,1,"Yes, but if they check the credit file again before releasing the funds for completion, surely seeing a credit check for home insurance can only be a positive?"
home insurance when buying a house,litfan35,1,"you do realise most if not all mortgages require the buyer to have home insurance in place, yes?

your point applies for other lines of credit, but is useless and dangerous when it comes to insurance"
home insurance when buying a house,Artois55,1,"I did all the research before using the compare websites. So I had my quotes ready and knew which one I was going with. 
On the day, I just proceeded from the compare website to the provider website and set it to start from the next day."
home insurance when buying a house,marianorajoy,1,"I believe the sort of checks are soft checks just to check your identity as an FCA regulated business. 

There's no line of credit involved, you can technically cancel your policy at any time and you wouldn't be liable for the outstanding amount. Obviously you'll be in breach of your mortgage terms, but that's a different story. 

Just as an example, I have more tan 200 softchecks this year, as I have several credit check providers. I doubt the lender will know which one of those is an insurance. If they ask for proof, it will be your insurance certificate. There's no other way of knowing."
home insurance when buying a house,[deleted],2,"At no point did I say don't get insurance. I said don't take out credit for said insurance.

 But you knew that. The only dangerous advice is saying its fine to take out new credit. Just pay for the damn insurance outright. It's not worth the risk."
home insurance when buying a house,litfan35,1,"Not necessarily. Phone providers do a hard search when they're giving you a monthly contract (if you're a new customer). It basically depends on whether the company sees it as taking out credit or not. Most people don't associate a new phone contract as taking out credit, and yet the company treats it exactly like that. Some insurance companies that I've seen only have 12-month fixed contracts so while you can pay in monthly instalments, if you cancel you do still need to pay the remaining difference - I think. I've never tried to cancel it, admittedly, so not entirely clear on that

edit: no one but you can see soft searches on your file. they're mostly just for your own reference"

Many lenders, including Halifax, have buildings insurance requirements incorporated into their T&Cs, and it's always from exchange. When we were buying we were instructed to sort the insurance in advance, make sure it subscribed to all kinds of terms and conditions, including that the lender was noted as an interested party on the policy, so it was ready to go with a phone call on the day of exchange.

Landlord selling the freehold to us kicks us out of home insurance,Wonder_8484,3,"You should try to continue cover with the same insurer. Is the freehold held in a company or personal name. If there is a freehold company, then buy the shares in the company.

 You need to make good and get a specialist surveyor to say all issues resolved.... They insurers would need to see that.

Making such a claim to insurer is going to mark the property. As you have to declare to new insurers and as you found out, will not cover subsidence. 

I have similar issues. Let me know how you get on."
Landlord selling the freehold to us kicks us out of home insurance,Lopsided-Let-5995,1,"Thanks! I want to continue with the same insurer, but apparently they refused (this has all been conveyed to me through other tenants, will call them on Monday). We will buy the freehold in our individual names.

The thing is the crack was made good by adding some mortar and re-tiling the interior etc. The tree was cut down. They then tracked movement of the building using distance measurers. Upon observing no movement for 6 months, a structural surveyor came and said it was all fixed.

As it stands with the current landlord we have subsidence cover and there is no problem, but I find it weird that we have to renew insurance now that he has issued a section 5 (meaning we have to buy the freehold or otherwise a management company will). It's a lose lose, as if we do not buy the freehold the new management company will have to renew insurance without subsidence cover."

Home insurance issue post building survey,serennow,1,"Thanks. The surveyor wrote ""It is essential that you check with your insurer to make sure that a roof without undercovering is insurable and included in any insurance schedule"". Talking to insurance companies this doesn't seem to be a worry."
Home insurance issue post building survey,serennow,1,"This is true. But, what I'm keen to find out is if the fact two major companies (the first two we contacted) won't insure it is suggestive that there may be some problem we're unaware of that might make us think twice about buying. Or, do underwriters often have individual quirks that mostly are due to things that shouldn't worry the average buyer."
Home insurance issue post building survey,itallstartedwithapub,2,I would leave that to your solicitor's searches and enquiries. If there's a high risk of flooding it will come up in searches.

Home Emergency Cover (insurance),TommyVasec,2,"Personally I did opt to take it out, wasn't too much money and we didn't have a stack of spare cash

We had that for a couple years when we moved in and claimed on it once, we had rodent cover too and had rats and mice in the roof.

It worked out worth doing and put my mind at ease for that initial part of owning a house, but now we have an emergency fund we don't bother"
Home Emergency Cover (insurance),Kitstep,1,"Having worked in customer service for home insurance, I wouldn’t bother.  The cover it offers in my experience is fairly limited and you’re much better having a small emergency fund as opposed to this additional insurance.  

It may not be the same for every type of this cover but they’re fairly canny about what the constitute as “emergency”.  I.e.  if you have a burst pipe, they’d come out and shut off your water but that would be the end of their involvement.  It would then be up to you and your regular insurance to get a permanent fix and repair any resulting damage.  

As I say, I may have just not come across a decent version of this insurance or my opinion may be skewed because much of the feedback I received on it was complaints (which is to be expected in customer service).   It might be helpful to get the perspective of someone who’s used the insurance so hopefully you’ll get more answers!"
Home Emergency Cover (insurance),Catoula,1,"As someone who also worked as a HE consultant, I would say that its great for certain things, but not others.  A boiler breakdown would get you a contractor coming out to diagnose the issue for the most part, dipping into your claim reserves for very little; and burst pipes entail someone coming out and isolating the leak.  It all depends on the policy wording, especially the general exclusions, which is what people tend to miss out and then get not nice surprises about what’s not actually covered.  Its best to get your own plumber and make a paying claim, if your policy allows it, in these situations.  The security and pest control elements work pretty well.  Each policy is going to be a bit different but I understand now, from the inside, that the main incentive is keeping hold of premiums, not really the well being of the customers, so be warned."
Home Emergency Cover (insurance),OrganicDetective7414,2,"Cheers for taking the time to answer, really appreciate it. 

I think the kind of confirms what I was thinking, and I’d be better off putting the money in an emergency fund"

What Kind of Occupancy is this Classed as for Home Insurance?,Anaksanamune,7,"For these things the best thing to do tends to be to write up some sort of token agreement.

What Kind of Occupancy is this Classed as for Home Insurance?,rich_b1982,2,"You'd be a licensee. You wouldn't have a tenancy as these usually include an obligation to pay rent.

Your legal right of occupation comes from the permission of the property owner."
What Kind of Occupancy is this Classed as for Home Insurance?,treeseacar,1,"If you are paying bills you are a tenant even if you pay no rent. If your mum has a mortgage on this property she would need to either let you love there entirely rent free and pay all bills herself, or set up as a BTL landlord and have you pay rent. And she pay appropriate tax on any profit (but presumably there won't be any profit in its just an accounting exercise) and apply all safety requirements as specified by your council. But renting a BTL to family requires a regulated BTL mortgage as most standard BTL terms prohibit renting to family.

If there is no mortgage on the property she can do whatever arrangements she likes. Not that any of this is your problem it's your mums. But these things can upset mortgage lenders when they think someone is renting their property without permission.

You would best placed to call the insurance company and ask. But insuring your contents as a tenant is probably the right option as you don't own the property. You don't need to pay rent to be classed as a tenant. The owner will be responsible for buildings insurance. 

You may wish to get a formal AST tenancy set up even if rent is just £1. This gives you protections if you fall out with your mum and she wants to kick you out."

Home Insurance Company charged me 50% of my initial premium for having bathroom and kitchen renovation?

Very normal."
Home Insurance Company charged me 50% of my initial premium for having bathroom and kitchen renovation? Normal?,gardenpea,4,"In a word, yes. 

As a FTB with the home unoccupied for the first 6 weeks, having a new kitchen put in (structural work according to the insurance companies) and being self employed with WFH and stock stored at home... none of the normal insurance companies would touch me with a bargepole, I had to go to specialist insurance brokers (Certis gave the best quote) and I ended up paying about double what the quotes were on compare the market."
Home Insurance Company charged me 50% of my initial premium for having bathroom and kitchen renovation? Normal?,treeseacar,3,"It's because you are not living there, and there are unsupervised contractors doing things to water and electricity. Plus kitchen and bathroom are essential to having a habitable home. Some insurers are more sympathetic than others but I'd still expect a charge for covering it. Thing is now that you've mentioned it, if you don't pay then they won't insure you. So you will have to go elsewhere which may or not cost more."
Home Insurance Company charged me 50% of my initial premium for having bathroom and kitchen renovation? Normal?,throw4455away,5,Yeah I definitely think it’s the unoccupied aspect making it so expensive. When we had a new kitchen our insurer didn’t care as we were living there. The installers fitted a new radiator in the kitchen and adjusted radiators elsewhere in the house. The radiator in our bedroom wasn’t tightened properly and a bit later I noticed water on our sofa. If we hadn’t been living in the house we would not have known about this and the living room ceiling would have probably come down by the morning!

Home Insurance Company charged me 50% of my initial premium for having bathroom and kitchen renovation? Normal?,gardenpea,4,"When I say double, I mean it went from £250 to £500 a year, and there was the added factor of my self employment that contributed to that. It will come down once the works are finished (back to brick kitchen renovation here). 

If £250 is going to swing it for you in terms of getting a doer upper, it's really not for you.

Home Insurance and Rebuild Cost - Do I understand?,[deleted],2,"Most policies are tiered. Basically, they will insure you to rebuild your house, up to £1m in cost/value.

If your house would cost more than £1m to rebuild, then you'd need the next tier of insurance which would cost more."
Home Insurance and Rebuild Cost - Do I understand?,itallstartedwithapub,2,"They'll insure up to the actual rebuild cost, as long as it isn't higher than £1m. If the rebuild cost is higher than £1m the insurer will likely pay out proportionally to the underinsured amount i.e. if the total rebuild cost is £3m and your insurance is £1m, they'll pay a third of the actual costs on a buildings claim.

If you mean, will they give you £1m cash if your house needs rebuilding, then no."
Home Insurance and Rebuild Cost - Do I understand?,Stringsandattractors,1,"This is what I’m sort of confused about.. this is basically how I thought it worked. But my current policy just says insured about to the figure I gave as the rebuild cost. Which makes me a little uneasy, as the rebuild cost isn’t a hard and fast figure..!"
Home Insurance and Rebuild Cost - Do I understand?,Stringsandattractors,1,"Right. So what those results show me is the maximum my rebuild cost could be. I won’t be insured to a million just because it says so there..! 

So it’s normal for a policy to cover building up to the rebuild cost. (I probably sound really silly...)"
Home Insurance and Rebuild Cost - Do I understand?,itallstartedwithapub,2,"If your house burns down, the insurer will manage the rebuild and the costs. They won't allow you to design a new house based on a £1m budget."
Home Insurance and Rebuild Cost - Do I understand?,Notmyrealname08,2,"The RICS produces a table of construction costs which are, of course, unrelated to the sale value of the house. A good guide is about £1,200/per square metre."
Home Insurance and Rebuild Cost - Do I understand?,Stringsandattractors,1,"Yeah sure. I don’t think I’m phrasing my question well.

Basically my current insurer go by my rebuild cost. Building is covered up to £200,000 (for example). So if it ends up costing more due to whatever reason I’m screwed. 

Other insurers have tiers of ‘up to 1m’, ‘up to 2m’. So that would cover me to rebuild without me needing to lay down an estimated figure and being wrong if labour/material costs shoot up. Obviously just to rebuild as is, not to build my dream house! I am comfortable to assume that it would cost ‘up to 1m’ to rebuild my house, rather than up to the estimated rebuild cost!"

Is it cheeky to ask our mortgage broker why their home insurance quote is so expensive?,Bell8oy,3,"The mortgage broker will be getting paid by the lender, the amount is usually on the mortgage illustration, or offer letter.
It's all about upselling from that point on, house insurance, life insurance etc with what sounds like some big margins. I would tell them you have found a better deal elsewhere and take it. It's unlikely to affect the relationship as they will want to keep you on their books for subsequent product changes every 2-5 years (assuming you took a fixed rate deal)."

"living in Scotland, first time buying, wondering how comprehensive my home insurance should be",EdenRubra,1,">don't have an option to cover breakage to windows 

What makes you say this? windows form part of the structure. They will cover them (unless its accidental damage and you don't have accidental damage cover), you should check with the insurance company if you're unsure.

&#x200B;

>one worry is the boiler/heating system or electric not working or breaking down in the first year will insurance cover this they all seem to use different terms to cover different packages, I've seen the term ""emergency breakdown cover"" which usually has to be added as a bonus at about £61 extra for the year will ease that worry

What does the policy terms say? 

For Aviva breakdowns are not covered unless you have emergency cover, you can read their policy to see what's covered if taking out that option. 

>does the gas mains pipes fall under my responsibility for maintenance until the pipes reach the end of my garden and then the council/gas company maintain it from the street access from there, does insurance cover this and what is that term/package called. 

You need to look at the deeds and see what is you're responsibility and what isn't, you also need to look and see what falls under shared responsibility.

For pipes you need to see where the water and gas companies' responsibility stops. Water for examples is usually to the main stopcock, if you have one shared water supply you need to see who is responsible for it, presumably contained within the deeds.

you may or may not be required to take out common insurance, or may be personally responsible for common areas. You need to take out appropriate insurance"

How long ago was the work done? The longer it's been the less likely there will be any comeback from the council.

A structural report will tell you whether the garage is sound, safe and not going to fall down. Hopefully you've already had a RICS level 2 or 3 survey though so that would usually flag up any issues with construction.

If you have no life insurance then the mortgage would not be paid off, so the bank you have the mortgage with would want the property to be sold so that they can get their money back. Any remaining equity would then firm part of your estate and go to your parents. 

Making a will would ensure your estate goes to whoever you choose."

Sort out if you need life insurance. Sort out income protection. Sort out a Will.

I would only add... Talk to your mortgage advisor as well. When we applied for a mortgage, Nationwide grilled deep in our financial planning to make sure the house could be paid off if either of us died. Even though my husband has substantial benefits from work, they offered us additional coverage.

Just as important is the will and making sure your children go to the right people, even if they're not family, who would raise your children with your values and honour your parenting, not just, like, take the house and treat your children like an unwanted burden.

The aim of life insurance is to provide for those you leave behind - so pay off the mortgage/provide a lump sum to keep them going bow they've lost the breadwinner.   If you don't have anyone,  no point imho.  

When I snuff it,  the house gets sold, mortgage paid with proceeds and assets get split between my nominated beneficiaries.   I don't see the point in paying a fee every month so that they get even more money, to the detriment of my current existence.  And 200 a month sounds steep.

What you should make sure you have (and um, yup I don't have this in place either!), is critical illness cover and/or income protection.  This pays out a lump sum (or on-going money) that helps you pay your mortgage off while you're still alive but unable to keep earning.

Especially as it seems you're away for weeks at a time. 

What do you do if the mum gets a boyfriend do you allow him to stay over in your house when you're not there? Are you willing to make accommodations for the child like a space for toys and things in the living room? Do you own expensive things you will have to move out of the way so the child can't get to them that will negatively impact your enjoyment of the house if they are packed away somewhere? Are you willing to be woken up on the weekend by the sounds of a child running round and playing? 

I sound negative but the point I'm trying to make is adding a child to your life that isn't yours or a partners is going to be a big change for a single late 30's male and you may find the savings outweigh the benefits and enjoyment of your own home, thr things I've mentioned are just some of the issues you csn expect with a child but there could be lots more or you might not come across any of those things but it's something to think about.

Another thing to think about is, why is a mother wanting to lodge in someone else's house with her child? She should be a high priority for a council house if she's homeless with a young child. Who has vouched for her and how much do you trust this person? Why has she ended up in this position?

Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,Electronic_Wash6493,23,"Get it written into the agreement that the child is not to be in the house without the mother present; or as you get more friendly you may be roped into free babysitting.

It is reasonable for a child to have play dates. Given how often you're on the road, so you really want to come home to a house of four children running around your living space?

Have you agreed expectations with the mother about you having friends over? People can be very wary of who is in the house with their child; if you want a couple of friends over for beers and a movie in an evening, at what point will you wake the child up and make the mother angry? At what point would the mother ask you to let her know before bringing strangers into her daughter's home? 

Other people have covered how kids can - and will - break anything they get their hands on. Would you expect the mother to replace anything broken? 

All of these things can be resolved with discussion and writing things into the lodger agreement. But can make life a misery if not done in advance"
Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,test_test_1_2_3,14,"There is no way on earth I would  have a parent and small child as lodgers unless I knew the parent personally and quite well.

It’s way too many variables and a small child brings in safeguarding concerns. You really shouldn’t open yourself up to that risk, if you and the mother fall out things could get unpleasant.

Finally, living with a 6 year old is not to be underestimated. It will be far more disruptive than a single adult lodger, your possessions will inevitably get broken if left out and the house will likely just be way more messy.

You would be mad to do this unless you know the woman well, you don’t so don’t do it."
Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,Fit_General7058,12,"If you are away a lot, you'll end up the stranger and inteloper in your own home.

Further, it would be so easy for her to get you barred from your own home should you let her get her feet under the table. 

You don't know this woman, you don't know who she hangs around with, you don't know who she would bring into your home, or what she would allow in your home. 

Do not do it,   single professional people who do not want to put down roots in your house.  A mother and child would be free to make it their home with you out of the way most of the time, you would be giving your home away.

Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,internetpillows,18,"Something nobody has touched on here is that you will need to protect yourself from a potential relationship scam. At any point in the future, the lodger could claim that you two are in a romantic relationship and this can cause a variety of problems for you. One is that she could claim that her rent is actually for the mortgage, and she could then claim some of the equity in your house built up over the years she lives there.

Ensure that there is a lodger's agreement written up and signed, that everything is sent by email so there's a permanent record of it, and that you pay the correct tax on your rental income (there's a 7500/year tax break under the rent a room scheme). Another thing people say is to make sure the amount of rent she's paying is not exactly the same as your mortgage or exactly half of the mortgage as these could be indicators that her money was intended for the mortgage.

It's not likely to happen and is easy to protect yourself against but just be aware that this is a thing that has happened to people."

What's going to happen when the child is naughty - are you going to tell off the child like a parent would, do nothing, or hope the mother does something? What if the mother does nothing and also objects to you doing anything? What if you have entirely different standards of behaviour?

Personally I’d struggle to relax with that. Thirdly in order for this chasm to feel at home- because it is their home after all- they will need to feel they can have their stuff in the communal spaces.

Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,FatBloke4,8,">A friend of mine introduced them to me and provided personal guarantee about finances and character of the mother.

A personal guarantee is a legally binding contract, under which the guarantor has to pay the debt owed, if the subject of the guarantee does not.  But I sense you only some reassuring words from a friend.  A former close friend once said she would be a personal guarantor for her sister, who then stayed at my house.  It didn't work out and she left while I was away, owing a significant sum of money and when I asked my friend about the personal guarantee, she simply refused to help.  Bottom line: if you don't have a legal contract, you have nothing.

There's useful info here: [Rent a room in your home](https://www.gov.uk/rent-room-in-your-home) and [Letting rooms in your home: a guide for resident landlords](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letting-rooms-in-your-home-a-guide-for-resident-landlords). 

In theory, a lodger has fewer rights than a tenant but if things go bad, you will be hard pressed to find a court to rule against a single mother and her child - plus, the courts have backlogs of many months.  All the mother has to do is make an allegation that you were somehow inappropriate towards her daughter and you lose.

IMO, it is not worth the risk.  It's sad that this is how things are but the law/justice system would be stacked against you if anything goes wrong."

Good luck with that. Councils are notorious for palming people off if they can find their own private rentals. She may be high priority but there may also be a 100 other higher priorities in front of her before she gets a home allocated to her. Having lived in what they call ""temp accommodation"" whilst waiting for a council place, I can tell you that private renting is a far better option. If she's not working, she will still qualify for housing benefit towards her rent, so she's not losing out. 

Councils love private renters as it takes the heat off them."

Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,Iforgotmypassword126,20,"Just to add that having a child doesn’t mean you will get a council house or support anymore. They’ll probably want her to spend some nights / weeks in a hostel for women and children to evidence her homeless status and for a lot of people that’s just not something they are prepared to put their child through, so they continue to try and manage with private renting arrangements. Additionally if someone is seen to leave a private renting situation and declares themselves homeless, the council can refuse to help because they were “voluntarily homeless”. So she may have tried and failed to get support from the council, and that might not be her fault. 

I wouldn’t say that this woman had red flags for wanting to lodge, after all you’ve been recommended to her by a mutual friend. However lodging really really isn’t the ideal when you have a small child. But the reason could be that she just cannot afford rent for a whole home on her salary, and she doesn’t meet the council criteria for a council home (aka being homeless).

I imagine she’d very much struggle to find anyone who was willing to take a lodger as a single mother and small child, unless it was another single mother looking to share the load with a friend. 

The only other people I can imagine being open to letting a non relative/ or romantic partner single mother and young child share their home is a paedophile. So it does show you the precarious situation she is in."

My overarching point was that this is something that should be discussed in advance and the agreement drawn up if necessary. 

Your valid point about babysitters is something else that should be discussed; does OP want a say in who those babysitters are? Given - by definition - they will be in the house unsupervised, so it's not like inviting a guest round.

Is OP comfortable with the lodger doing the stereotypical 90s thing of paying a local teenager to babysit? Personally I wouldn't want a teenager I've never met being in my house with no supervision, let alone having them monitor a 6yo."

Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,Iforgotmypassword126,16,"I’m in Manchester and they seem to change the rules month by month here or person by person. However I have friends with small babies and risking homelessness for various reasons (relationship breakdown, family death, no fault eviction). 

If you get an eviction notice and leave on the final day of the tenancy, you don’t get help because you made yourself voluntarily homeless. They expect you to stay in against the landlords permission and make the landlord take you to court, have you evicted, and have a terrible reference, before they’ll add you to the very long list. In the meantime it will be a hostel. 

If you attend and you haven’t voluntarily made yourself homeless (aka leaving your family home or private’s rented home) you’ll be asked to stay at a hostel for a week, this will usually budge up your bidding power so you can start to request properties and it will boost your number to a higher status.
However there’s issues of drugs, violence, noise, theft and mental health issues in these hostels and they are not somewhere you want your child to be if you have any options. 

They do sometimes do a hotel stay but that’s usually if they council are the ones making you homeless or have made your home uninhabitable and it’s less than 3 nights really and just to get you out of the house. Usually it’s bugger families too, like they’ll shove a family of 4 into a room with two double beds and throw a few pot noodles at you. 

I personally feel like the homeless hostels are a threat to weed out people who lie about being homeless. That you have to be really desperate to stay there and that proves you need the housing. But what they don’t consider is that people literally sleep with their kids in cars overnight to avoid these hostels. 

Ive not known anyone do the HMO route yet but I’m sure they’ll do it here. We don’t have as many HMOs but they’re on the rise."

My niece is 6 and there is child related stuff in every room in my sisters house (certificates on fridge, toys in the lounge,kids stuff in the bathroom etc). Not a problem with your own child, might not be the same with the child of a lodger.

What if you want to bring a new partner home for a meal/stay over? Would you feel comfortable doing this with a child in the house?"
Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,TimeInitial0,5,"Also kids ate borderline suicidal and destroyed things in their spare time 🤣.

Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,Ecstatic-Gas-6700,2,"God, that’s a long and complicated answer that I’m not sure I can fully articulate. It seems that the term female has crept into misogynist language and it’s now difficult to not associate the speaker with that line of thinking, UNLESS female is being used in a scientific setting. 

“The word ‘female’ has been used in derogatory ways to devalue and criticize women. Over time the use of ‘female’, when talking about women, has taken on a range of negative associations. As a result, using ‘female’ strips women of their value. It communicates the idea that the woman’s sole purpose is reproduction. That she is the same as an animal. That she is inferior to men. ‘Female’ can apply to any species, while ‘woman’ refers specifically to humans.”

Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,RevolutionaryTale245,2,What about *male*? Would it be misandrist to use the term?
Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,JiveBunny,6,"OK, but this is different from referring to 'a female' in casual discussion such as this when it would be far more natural to say 'woman' - that's very much an incel thing, and so the assumption made of anyone doing the same is that they subscribe to that school of thought. 

I find it unusual that someone on Reddit, especially someone who sees themselves as a person who reads the news often, hasn't come across this before, as it's become very well documented in the past few years.  Lots of things are ""just a word"" in one context and very loaded in others."
Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,Ecstatic-Gas-6700,5,"🤷‍♀️sometimes it is correct, specifically when used as an adjective rather than noun.

They were talking about like defining someone as a female.

Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,ProtoplanetaryNebula,1,"Yes, I heard of the points you have made before too, so no need to google. It does look like some people have started doing that, but equally the vast majority of people are unaware of this trend and continue to speak like they always have and then unwittingly get labelled a sexist. 

I think there is much bigger chance someone is not aware of this trend than they are aware and are using it in a derogatory way."
Getting a single mother with a 6 y.o daughter as lodgers,ProtoplanetaryNebula,1,"As I mentioned in another comment, most people are not aware that extremely recently some sections of the internet have deemed this a negative usage, so most people just keep on using it as they always have done. 

If words suddenly change meaning, it's not really fair to condemn people who are not aware of the revised usage and continue using it in the previously understood way."

What about medical? Buying creams and ointments and so forth costs a duck ton these days. Get a wort and that's £12 down the drain. Cold sore and that's £6.00.

In theory your numbers hold up. But I'm telling you it's not going to be floaty. Your mortgage will be permanent with no chance of escape, your savings will be paltry, with a battle in your head each month whether to save or to treat yourself, but not both.

It's fine if you intend to aim for larger heights and better pay.

How many years would your mortgage be locked in for?

Have you got a significant amount of spare money for the initial products for your first home which will follow you between homes? Is there space to fit a washing machine or are you paying a local dry cleaners 35 a month to wash your clothes?

Fridge. Oven. Bed. Flat repairs/cleanup. Sofa. TV. Dining table. dining chairs. Socket extensions. All the costs and effort  involved with moving these products into a home.

If inflation doesn't keep destroying us. I think you could do it. Do be aware that if house prices drop putting you in negative equity, this could be your life for a long time."

On the rent Vs buy, unless Labour bring in punitive rent controls, or offer tax breaks to BTL landlords it's a reasonable assumption that rents are only going in one direction. 

Your mortgage costs could be fixed for 5 years, and you can overpay when you get pay rises so you keep paying 8/18th of your income to the mortgage. 

Essentially can you live on a grand a month? If not, is a relationship on the cards and/or is the flat big enough to rent a room out as that's what my friends did when they were first buying, so got an easy few hundred a month plus utilities bills split, as well as some company."

No building regulation approval for windows changed last year,itallstartedwithapub,4,"Personally I wouldn't be bothered by missing building regs/FENSA for a like-for-like window replacement. The chance of any issues with enforcement is just so minimal, and if they visually look properly fitted, there's a very good chance they're fine.

But if your lender cares then you might not have a choice.

Yes you'll have the same issue again when you come to sell, and the buyer will have the same options to take indemnity etc."
No building regulation approval for windows changed last year,[deleted],2,"Fensa isn't worth anything in my experience. Twice I've had UPVC its been botched and caused problems. 

Depending on age of property if wooden have become UPVC then lintels may have been required for the outside leaf on installation of upvc. I'd just get your surveyor to assess this has been done if required.

More modern houses will likely be OK anyway as they don't usually rely on the windows to support the brickwork like older properties did."
No building regulation approval for windows changed last year,EnormousMycoprotein,2,"I would not lose any sleep over it.

In theory, any change of a window should either have been signed off by a building control officer, or carried out by someone registered on a competent persons scheme (the big one being FENSTRA).

In practice neither the building control sign-off or the FENSTRA certificate are any reliable indication that your window is correctly installed, as the former do only the most cursory of checks, and the latter are often cowboys. 

This renders the whole bureaucratic song and dance fairly pointless in regards to you knowing that your windows are in properly or not.

Regards indemnity policies, this is a perfectly normal thing to have in in place when a house is sold, to cover all sorts of little quirks like this. In my experience the seller should take out the policy rather than the buyer.

For example, when I bought my current house, at the request of my solicitor, the seller took out an indemnity policy against the fact that nobody could prove if the conservatory was build before or after conservatories required building regs, and also against the fact that technically lord someone-or-other could turn up and demand some years of unpaid Ground Rent, at six shillings and sixpence per annum.

The policy cost them about £80.

When I come to sell, I suspect the buyer's solicitor will ask the same of me.."

If it was catastrophic acute damage (burst pipe, etc...) you'd have more of a leg to stand on.

Just my opinion, my salaried time runs £50-60/hr and I wouldn't fell the fight worth it and the vendor was asked one time. Maybe one threatening letter if they were an asshole about it, but this will go down in legal technicalities and not get your stuff fixed rapidly. If I was the vendor/seller, I'd slow-walk the process if you didn't go away.

 I would simply tear it all out and build what I wanted anyways as I always do that when moving into a place and buy places with that in mind."

I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,TyrannosauraRegina,2,If it’s high risk for flooding then quotes will be higher as the risk of the insurance having to cover massive costs is big. Put it in a comparison site though and see what you get.

I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,Loud_Low_9846,1,Unless you live in the middle of a flood plain I'd say that was way too high.  Perhaps try a few of the comparison websites as mentioned on the money saving website.

We found that HomeProtect and MBNA were reasonably priced - much less than you've been quoted. The comparison sites weren't reliable for flood risk, in that they were dramatically underestimating and we were getting much higher quotes when going directly. Somehow the comparison sites weren't really pricing in the flood risk even though they had some flood-related questions (which isn't a good thing as it can invalidate your policy - no point paying a ""cheap"" price for no insurance once they find out)."

I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,Longshot318,1,"It largely depends on the reinstatement cost for the whole building ie what would it cost to totally rebuild it. This obviously varies from building to building. When was that cost last checked by a surveyor?

These values are normally increased by an indexed figure by the insurance companies yearly but it worth an independent valuation every 3-5 years to doublecheck.  I did this recently on a portfolio of properties and about half came in below the indexed figure.

From a different pov it also means you can be sure you’re not under insured. No-one wants high premiums but, if the worst happens, you really don’t want to discover you’re only covered for 75% of the rebuild cost!"
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,[deleted],1,it's pretty normal for flats especially if your buildind has some sort of associated fire/cladding risk as documented through EWS1
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,purte,1,Before we moved we had a 50% share of freehold (2 converted flats in the building). No management co. I arranged the buildings insurance through a broker and both us freeholders shared the annual cost (c£400pa total) - south coast UK.  A couple years ago we paid for and shared the cost for a rebuild / reinstatement valuation (£105) as it hadn’t had a valuation for many years. When we first moved there we had to have a different type of policy as we were owner occupiers and the flat above was rented out. And then a different policy when both flats were owner-occupied. I’d recommend going through a broker than via an insurer as they’ll be able to advise what you actually need to be properly covered (if you are the freeholder of course).

I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,Felissen,5,"This is correct, I'm also a share of a freehold. There is one policy for the whole building and this is covered in the service charge payment. A separate policy contents only for just my flat.

You can't do a building policy in just your name as it would not be valid if something happened to the building. You are jointly responsible with all the other share of freehold owners."

I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,Magsmagss,1,"Hey there thanks for that info! 

Exactly, comparison sites are not accurate, and most of them won’t provide a quote just because there is a small river within 200m from the property. The house never experienced flooding but because of its proximity to this river it’s high risk right away.. which is scary. 

Were defences installed by you in your house or by the local authorities on the water source?

Also can I know how much is the price of that insurance? 

Thanks a lot!"
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,Magsmagss,1,Hey thanks for that info. Is it building + contents? Are you in a flood risk area?
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,xxnicknackxx,3,So 805 for the building? Or just for your share? Rebuild value of the building affects the price.
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,FarIndication311,1,"Believe there are some unique scenarios you can, for example if it's a converted house, one flat is already with insurer x, you also will need insurer x. This is to avoid disputes about party walls / floors / roof etc and who's liable.

You and the freeholder may need to find an alternative insurer, perhaps specifically one who's in the Flood Re government scheme. Government backed re insirance scheme to make flood risk more affordable. (You can't get a policy from Flood Re however many insurers are part of the scheme. May not be mentioned in policy documents etc)."
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,cragwatcher,5,Yeah will just have dig down the back of the sofa
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,cragwatcher,1,Nope
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,eerst,3,Needs to be a single policy. You can't rebuild half the property now can you? First floor flats don't just hang in the air.
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,FarIndication311,1,Share of freehold is a form of leasehold.
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,stutter-rap,1,"The local authorities built a proper flood defence scheme on the river which flooded. We also have a stream about 5m in front of our house. I think our current flood risk is estimated as low but of course we have to declare the past flood as they always ask that question.

We're paying something like £300 this year and paid about £450 last year, terraced house. Our quote from HSBC, who provide our mortgage, was £750 and a lot were around that ballpark."
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,Tickboxer,1,If flood risk is causing the high premium price (it's twice what I pay in London for a 2 x 1 bed flats in a converted house) you could have flood excluded from the policy to keep the price down. Of course that would mean if it did flood.....
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,Magsmagss,3,Just for my share! Even when they asked for the rebuild price they asked for my flat only knowing it is a conversion. Just for my flat sounds too pricey 😞

I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,Magsmagss,1,That’s very good! Thanks for your help! I’ll try calling those.
I was quoted £805 for annual insurance on a 2 bed 2 bath garden flat,xxnicknackxx,3,"Are you arranging a single policy in only your name, for only your part of the building, or are you talking about your share of a single policy owned by all the freeholders?"

Unoccupied House Insurance,[deleted],3,"Ex broker. Usually normal insurance will suffice but it might not. All that usually happens if it's unoccupied for more than the conditions state (usually 30-60 days) is that you lose certain protections like burglary. If you sleep over once every 30 days it will maintain cover.

Other option would be to use a provider like LV which cater for this. For an extra charge they'll tell you what to do to maintain cover. Eg make sure rubbish doesn't pile up, collect mail, leave heating on etc."

Unoccupied House Insurance,Big-Ad-2009,2,"Thank you, foolishly on my part, my insurance has been cancelled as originally completion was set for 1st April. They are unable to recommence this now, so I just need something to cover one month (potentially more if further delays)"
Unoccupied House Insurance,Big-Ad-2009,1,Thank you! Had a quote on there but only covers 12 months. Might have to bite the bullet and use these and pay their cancellation fee
Unoccupied House Insurance,[deleted],2,Any chance you can just sleep over one night a month anyway?
Unoccupied House Insurance,Big-Ad-2009,2,Yeah it can be done. Could I do that with LV then? Just for a month?
Unoccupied House Insurance,[deleted],1,"I think so. If you aren't breaking the 30/60 day rule then likely anyone would do it. There shouldn't really be any need to mention it. However if you have Ncd with one policy elsewhere you'd need to make sure it was OK to use it on a second policy

I just mentioned LV as they used to allow existing customers to pay a fee for full cover if they were eg going away for 6 months or any period more than the normal max vacancy."

Is buying better than renting?,TrueSpins,207,"The main benefit of buying is that at the end of it, you actually own a highly valuable asset. Owning a house in the UK - once the mortgage is paid off - gives you a huge amount of financial security. It also potentially gives your children financial security and provides a foundation for a more stable life.

That is the real benefit of buying. The day-to-day cost implications are of course important - but most people buy a house with their eye on the future - often the distant future.

The idea of reaching pension age and not owning a home makes me shudder - society and the state's support system are only going in one direction, and I for one don't want to find myself needing handouts when I'm 70."
Is buying better than renting?,[deleted],47,"There are two ways this could go.  The first is nothing changes, housing associations remain the same, you laugh all the way to the bank in 30 years time when your rent is just a fraction of other people's rents and mortgages.  The second is that something changes.  The probability of the second is huge and, if you're not prepared for it, could leave you in a way worse position than people who are already on the housing ladder, so these are what you should consider (and have a plan for)...

The biggest hole in your assumption is really that your pension lump sum will pay for a house in 30 years' time.  No, it won't.  In 30 years, houses will at least double in value, probably more.  It's a historic trajectory.  The house I bought 30 years ago for £58k is now around £220k in value.  40 years ago, my parents bought their house for £16k.  It's now valued at almost half a million (in the Midlands , not any big city).  Year on year, the housing market consistently out-paces wage growth. Your pension will likely not increase at that same rate, and you could end up in a situation where you can't afford to buy once you retire, and that would be the worst mistake you could possibly make because most pensions can't afford current-day rents.  Even if your rent is only £700 a month, that's £700 a month you would not be paying in retirement had you bought.  There are a lot of unknown variables in all this, to be fair.  The risk can possibly be mitigated if you anticipate inheriting in later life, and also I assume you're pretty young if you're speculating on 30 years, so plenty of time to get on the housing ladder which, unless you're definitely likely to inherit, you need to do by age 40 ideally.  If you choose this option, I would recommend taking the difference between your rent and what you would ordinarily pay, and save that for a future deposit (and take advice about that saving to see whether a LISA would be your most profitable/sensible option).

The next point to watch is the general performance of housing associations.  There is mounting debt across the sector and the model of tightly-fixed rents is rapidly becoming untenable, with repairs backlogs building up.  The problem here is you're at the behest of the government of the day, and any government could turn round and change that fixed-rent position for people not in need of income support (I would say that's a fairly likely position as the 'social housing' aspect of housing associations is still to help people who can't afford housing).   Right now, any private owner needs to honour the controlled rent increases, but again, a government might feel obliged only to those on low incomes.  One of the reasons this has not yet happened is that housing association debt is conveniently kept out of scope of public borrowing.  If that changes, pressure will be on to shift that debt to private investors.

Thirdly, things go wrong in life.  There are few people who have not been impacted by life-changing events such as job loss, death or divorce in a period of 30 years.  If you part-own a house already, you have a valuable asset you can sell (and the more mortgage you've paid off already, the better off you'll be).  Renting leaves you with nothing at all, unless you did save consistently during your tenure and now have a strong deposit set aside.

I can see why it makes sense NOW to do what you're doing, but there is a lot of scope for things to change and so you just need some kind of robust savings plan to cushion yourself against these eventualities."
Is buying better than renting?,[deleted],79,[deleted]
Is buying better than renting?,gravityhappens,85,The growth of house prices often exceeds wage increases.
Is buying better than renting?,jarry1250,16,"I don't necessarily disagree that if you assume no change in house prices, and you have a housing association tenancy, you may be better off. That's true for plenty of people in Germany.

But have you rerun your figures with rent 15% higher and 5 years into what I assume is a 25 year mortgage term?"
Is buying better than renting?,CountryBumpkn22,16,Your making the very dangerous assumption that you will be able to rent that property forever and that the rent will always be £480 which is highly unlikely. So at some point any savings you think you are making will end up being a waste as you will likely be asked to leave and have to rent somewhere else far more expensive
Is buying better than renting?,erm_what_,13,"Buying is about predicability and control over your surroundings.

You know the monthly cost won't go up (much), so you can plan for it. Hopefully wages go up over time so the mortgage makes up a smaller percentage of your take home each month. The rent will go up, so if it's 30% now then it'll always be around that, and if you're unlucky, much more if new houses aren't built. That 3% increase is fixed now but could change anytime.

Also, house prices tend to outpace inflation, so that £125k could easily end up being 50% of the value of the house.

Of course there's maintenance to account for with a house, but if you don't do it then you'll probably still have a roof over your head for a while."
Is buying better than renting?,i_dunt_get_it,13,"Dunno where you get your statistics from but £350/month on maintenance is insane. You're saying you expect to pay £126k on maintenance over 30 years?

I owned my house for 10 years (currently worth 280k) and I have spent maybe 5-6k on maintenance in that time on a replacement boiler and a roof repair plus other minor things.

Upgrades are optional and generally add to the house value. I also spent 4k on a bathroom upgrade.

That's 10k total including bathroom upgrade which works out to £83 per month.."
Is buying better than renting?,[deleted],36,"Buying is better than renting on the whole, yes. 

It’s just in your scenario it might not be as you’re getting around 50% off the market rent. So the question in the title is pretty stupidly worded."
Is buying better than renting?,VVRage,11,"With your maths you have justified renting….

Maybe it is 3% for lower value properties but mine is nearer 0.2%-0.5% cost

At the same time I kept my uk property when I eventually sold I basically got back the inflation adjusted value

So if you have limited finances renting can work 

But buying provides a good inflation hedge"

Not impossible of course buy just something to consider.
Is buying better than renting?,Infamous_Pay_6291,5,"You’re forgetting one huge thing. Equity. Say you buy a house for $100,000 after it’s payed off with interest it cost you $200,000 but after 30 years your house is worth $300,000. You have all the money you were saving in the house plus the extra $100,000 in equity. You don’t get that from renting. 

Also house prices might be rising slower where you are now but guess what. When people get priced out of other areas they go to where the prices are cheaper and start driving them up faster."
Is buying better than renting?,Fellowes321,3,"The first years of a mortgage are always tough but in 10 years time mortgage repayments become more manageable and you can overpay. Completing a mortgage in 20 years is possible unless you really overstretched or become ill/redundant. £658 pm may sound like a sizable sum today but in 10 or 20 years it will be laughably small. My parents house cost them £4000 in 1980. There’s no missing zero there. They sold in 2010 for £280 000. Yes they extended and made it much nicer than it was and the large garden became a selling point but that was an investment.

At the end, rents will have more than doubled but you have a secure home that’s yours. If you have kids you have an asset you can leave them. 

  
I like your optimism that a landlord updates the kitchen / bathroom every 10-15 years, that rent will only change at 3% and that future governments will not change the rules. Your calculations are based on many what ifs. If they pay off then well done if they don’t then you are working for longer"

Having said all that everyone’s situation is different and your rent is cheap if it suits your lifestyle at the minute I don’t see the harm really.

Is buying better than renting?,simianjim,3,"The main benefit for buying isn't necessarily a direct financial one, but the security. As a renter for many years before finally buying a house I've been at the mercy of landlords whacking up their rent or evicting so that they can sell the property or rent it out at a higher price. If they increase the rent you've got to weigh that up against the hassle of moving so it can feel like you don't have much choice. Each time you move you incur extra costs, not just for overlap of rents and cost of removals, but the time, energy and stress that comes with it each time it happens."
Is buying better than renting?,gperepere,2,"If you are lucky to have low rent it may be better, if you save the difference for your future when you don’t have income to continue to rent. We did have low ish rent as we had been there a while, so our new mortgage is more. When we moved out the next people to rent would pay £200 more then we did, therefore more than our mortgage."
Is buying better than renting?,supreme_harmony,2,"In your example you say your rent goes up by 3% every year, and is currently £480pcm. This means that next year it will be £494.4pcm and by year 30, your monthly rent will be £1131pcm. Over the 30 years, on average you will pay £761 rent every month.

On the other hand, we can expect the mortgage cost to stay the same in the 30 year period, which means if the maintenance costs stay the same as well, then you are about £100 better off every month when buying instead of renting. This is because you calculated the interest + maintenance costs to be around £650pcm. Even if the maintenance costs increase over this timeframe (which is highly likely), you are still expected to realise a minimal financial benefit from buying compared to renting."
Is buying better than renting?,Esp0sa,2,"If it's a housing association property, will you be able to stay there as your wages increase? We've bought now but we'd have had the eviction process started this year because I've returned to work making our household income too high to rent with the housing association. I imagine this will become more common as demand for social housing increases more and more. Also be careful with savings too, we had a clausing stating savings above X amount would trigger a termination of the tenancy. The above all makes sense really considering social housing is supposed to be there for those that can't buy."
Is buying better than renting?,ConsciousSky5968,2,The way I see it is that I don’t want to be renting by the time I’ve retired. The whole point of buying a property is to eventually have a sound investment and some financial freedom (once the mortgage is paid off) . With renting you’re gaining absolutely nothing long term. But with your current rental cost you can likely afford to save up a lot of money to eventually put down on a house when you’re ready too.
Is buying better than renting?,ariadneontheboat,2,"It’s the uncertainty of being evicted- say the landlord wants to sell. It never truly feels like it’s home, because it’s not yours. I never felt properly settled until I had my own home. I don’t grudge any money spent on it."
Is buying better than renting?,RyanH2796,2,"I don’t know anyone who’s spending 3% of their property value per year on maintenance.

When we bought our flat 3 years ago we spent around £10k-£12k on renovations which added probably around £20k to the value. Since then we’ve also got new windows which cost around £2k and added about £4k-£5k onto the value. Other than the occasional plumber we have spent nothing else.

So I’d say in terms of money we’ve spent on maintenance that hasn’t actively added value onto our property, that maybe totals £300 over the last 40 months.

Bought for £114,000 in June 2020, selling late this year/early next year for an expected £155,000-£170,000. Is there really any other maths needed?

The house we’re buying is £232,500. They bought it in 2000 for £24,995. So almost 10x value in 23 years. Keep that up then when I’m 50 I’ll have a house worth over £2m.

Missed out on one a month or so ago. We offered £240,000 on. They bought it 52 years ago for £4,000 so it’s doubled in price on average every 8 years.

Or you could save a small amount every month right now.

Is buying better than renting?,Melodic_Armadillo710,2,"Nope ;-) Can't unravel your calculations, but can tell you is this. Bought 25 years ago. Moved a couple times, ended up with scary mortgage of double original. Even so, last several years of mortgage payments were only £100-£200 PER MONTH for a house in a big city, compared to minimum £1200 p/month ppl pay just to rent a room in same area. (Comparable house rental +\-4-5k p/month). Paid off mortgage, house now free for rest of life. Maintenance isn't cheap of course but when you rent, you're still paying maintenance anyway, via rent or service charge. Being in control of this yourself is infinitely better than having a landlord (or council) decide what gets done. 

Pension: pffft. Paid more than £1000 a month into it for years. Its value is pathetic considering. Desperately wish I'd put the money into property instead. A friend who invested same amount into building a property portfolio now ridiculously wealthy, secure for rest of life. 

Thankful I bought rather than renting. It took 7 years to save the deposit. It was more expensive than rental to begin with and first few years undeniably tough - but interest rates were 15%! Made a lot of financial sacrifices, but situation reversed after a few years and at some point realised far better off than people still renting their homes. Also have control, and freedom to move or rent out. Buy if you can. It's a no-brainer."
Is buying better than renting?,Rent-Nest,2,"Your analysis makes sense, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Renting does provide financial flexibility, especially if you invest the savings wisely. Given your situation, it seems renting could be a financially suitable choice. You're avoiding the interest portion of the mortgage and unpredictable maintenance costs, which allows you to invest in your pension, potentially earning more in the long run. Plus, housing association limits on rent increases add stability. Ultimately, it depends on your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance. Weigh the pros and cons carefully, considering your individual circumstances and priorities."
Is buying better than renting?,miss_sigyn,2,"I can see how your calculation makes sense but in my area it is more expensive per month to rent than it is to buy and pay the mortgage.

I'd have to pay around £1000 to rent a house like that. 

A friend tried to rent a flat for £600 and couldn't find anything in the area. 

I agree that upkeep etc does eat massively into my wage each year and you do have to have a decent emergency fund in case anything important like the boiler breaks but financially, in my area, it makes sense to buy.

Is buying better than renting?,Robotniked,2,"That £350 per month number doesn’t pass the smell test - over the 30 years that would be £126,000 on a house worth £140,000. Taking your 3% figure and applying it to a home worth the U.K. average of £290,000, you are saying that an average homeowner can expect to spend £261,000 on maintenance over a 30 year term. Clearly most homeowners are not spending anything like that on maintenance. You are also in an amazingly good position rent-wise, in Glasgow rents are now £970 for a 2 bed flat, renting might be good for you for now, but that might easily change if the rent goes up. 

It feels like your numbers may be off on both sides - overestimating the cost of home ownership, and underestimating where rent rises may take you over the next 30 years. You are also making a bold assumption that house prices will stop increasing faster than inflation and therefore your £125k equivalent will buy you what it would today - it might happen, but if you had made that bet any time in the past 70 years you would have lost badly. You are the best judge of your own financial circumstances of course, but I’ve always felt that buying gives you a hell of a lot of financial security, you have a home at a fixed price, plus the right to basically do what you want with your property within reason without asking permission."
Is buying better than renting?,Existing-Instance,2,"If the interest on the mortgage is £300 and your current rent is £480, how are you saving money? To me it looks you're paying extra £170 pcm which is ~2k a year. Over 30 years, that's £60000 effectively wasted. Plus, by renting you have zero security, the landlord may decide to sell the house and essentially kick you out at any point. The first year you will be spending a bit more to decorate the house, or make modifications, sure. But it is for your benefit and you can do it at your own pace. At end of the renting for 30 years you will have paid a total of ~£173k and you will own nothing of it. By buying under these conditions you end up paying ~£237k (~£108k is interest) but you will own something that is worth something that has gone up in value for 30 years. Even with council tax, house insurance and whatnot, it is a no brainer, based on the case described, owning is definitely better than renting, and you could be saving around ~£65k (or more if you can afford overpayments) plus the added valuation of your new house for 30 years.

Also, we are at a stage where interest rates should start calming down, if not heading downwards even, so there is potential for the interest on the mortgage to come down over the next few years too, but no certainty as the BoE is too unpredictable."

Is buying better than renting?,DifferentMacaroon922,-3,"No it's not better than renting. Here's why:
1. You put 25% down payment (tens of thousands) to get a reasonable mortgage deal (around 5% today). That money could be invested in bonds that would return 8% annual on your money till end of bond term, then you get the money back that you originally lent them. Who's to say inflation won't run and the government keep increasing rates? In the 80s, intrest on Gilds was 18%/year and some unlucky people had mortgages offered to them at 20%/year, which was completely unfeasible even back then, when houses were much cheaper.
2. That deposit money is at risk until you pay the entire mortgage off. For example, if you loose your job, and you can't afford the relayments, they might reposses the property and sell it at auction for under it's market value, because all they are concerned about is getting their loan back. The rest of the money of what's left from proceeds, they'll give back to you, after c.a 7% auction fee.
3. If the housing market drops, that's your asset that dropped in value. That could mean you're in negative equity, which either means you'll have to cough up the difference to pay back the origional mortgage loan or you'll be unable to sell the house due to bankruptcy if you did, which means you're stuck where you are. You can't move for any new opportunity; job, relationship, or in with your parents etc.
4. If you're fortunate enough to sell at a profit, it probably means everywhere else is more expensive, so after you pay solicitor, estate agent, mortgage advisor, stamp duty and house moving help again, you aren't as far ahead as you thought you'd be. Kind of like 2 steps forward, one step back.
5. If it's your second home, or even if it's your only home but rented it out for more than 2 years, when you sell, any profit on capital gain of the property appreciation has to go through the tax man. He keeps 28% from the difference.
6. You still have utility bills to pay. Council tax these days is averaging 2k. Electricity and gas averaging 3k. Water £700. Although you're a home owner, you're still a slave to the system. Does it then matter to pay the landlord or the bank the £500/m.
7. If your home is worth quite a bit when you die, you can leave it in your will to your children, but if it's worth anything over £375k, guess what? You guessed it, the tax man wants a cut! This time it's 40% over and above the threshold of that level.
8. House maintenance costs are also something to consider. Plumbers, electricians, painters, roofing leaks etc.

We all dream of captial appreciation and living a more comfortable existence or leaving a legacy for our children, but this country will screw you one way or another! Soon it will be on terms of, ""you will own nothing and you'll be happy"""

Is buying better than renting?,DegenerateWins,1,"By far the biggest pro of owning a house is the forced saving. Buying a house is good for the normal person because they don’t have to think about it as savings, they can think about it as “replacing rent”.

You’re different, you’re running the numbers. That makes you likely to be financially savvy enough for renting to be far more comparable to owning than most people think.

The thing you don’t seem to have accounted for here is the value of the property. It sounds like you are saying the house is valued at £140k currently. In 30 years you have 125k in todays money, so 15k off. So it then becomes a housing vs inflation bet. Housing has historically far beat inflation, most people expect that to continue, if you don’t, renting leaves you up if you’re right. There are other benefits to renting, the flexibility and as you point out, lack of responsibility.

It’s often close enough if you are good with finances that it becomes about personal preference.

Is buying better than renting?,deju_,1,"Something you really need to weigh up on a personal level. While a lot of renters may be able to afford the mortgage, they are some what shielded from reality. As you mention there are maintenance costs that tend to slap you in the face at the worst times and Factoring costs are like the wild west! Coupled with the fact that you won't get that 3% rise protection from a mortgage lender. 

From the way you are speaking you seem very level headed and reasonable, looking at it from all angles. You will no doubt find the best solution for you."
Is buying better than renting?,Responsible-Being-96,1,"As someone whose parents paid off their mortgage, the financial security and peace of mind that afforded us was beyond any monetary cost. We were secure in the fact that, if either of my parents lost their jobs, they would have a house to live in and not have to worry about getting us shelter. My dad was able to retire early because we didnt have to worry about monthly mortgage/rents costs anymore. It was so incredibly relieving, especially for both my parents who grew up and spent much of their adult lives working class until my mum got a big promotion. 

Yes, at the moment, it works out as more expensive. But you have to way all the factors, not just monetary ones."

But in principle I'm not surprised there are some occasions where high house prices and/or low rents skew the decision to renting.

I think you should also compare reasonable 'worst' and 'best' case scenarios, what's the worst that could happen if you rent and your assumptions are wrong. What's the worst case scenario of you buy and your assumptions are wrong."

Is buying better than renting?,Mithent,1,"We did have pretty good rent for a long time and that was a reason not to worry too much about buying. One other factor, though, is the ability to improve and customise your house, which is limited in a rental (and even if you're allowed to, you probably are less inclined to improve the property when you don't own it). It's nice to be able to do what you want. However, that may not be important for you, I don't know."
Is buying better than renting?,Miserable-Ad7327,1,"Let's talk about the future of housing prices and the impact of inflation. In around 30 years, you can expect house prices to skyrocket, potentially doubling, tripling, or even becoming 5-7-10 times more expensive, depending on location.  
  
If we glance back at the statistics from 2000, houses were undeniably cheaper. But let's not forget that the cost of living was different back then. Inflation plays a big role here. It's the sneaky force that makes prices creep up over time, and it's always lurking in the background. The rate of inflation matters because, according to the Bank of England, without some inflation, there's no room for economic growth.  
  
So, here's the deal: If you take the plunge and buy a house now, you're essentially investing in your future. Why? Because when you retire, you won't have to worry about paying rent. That's the key takeaway from a financial perspective.  
  
Inflation is the silent beast eating away at your savings, and owning a house can be your fortress against it. If you saved x amount of money in 2000 that could buy you a 4 bed house, now it buys you a 2 bed house in best case scenario. Same thing will happen if you save money in 2023, in 2050 you will not be able to afford to buy the desired house because prices and the cost of living will be different."

I rented for years and was not very interested about buying, but that was in other countries where landlords are not the same as in the UK and rentals are protected for a set time (years, not months) and where you can decorate the house you are renting.

In the Uk rentals are insane: landlords can kick you out just because, you cannot put a nail in a wall, you have to sleep in a gross mattress, have ikea shite for every single piece of furniture, can't have pets, etc. That for me, was a big NONO. I would go back to renting if things were more human, as I like moving every 2/3 years."

Is buying better than renting?,IceDragonPlay,1,"You have stacked the assumptions, but even so, why do you think you could purchase a home for the same price in 30 years as it costs now? 

Normally you compare market rent to mortgage interest plus 1% upkeep, and you are correct that at current home prices and high interest rates favor renting, but that is in the short term. Over the long term it is more favorable to own. 

Rent costs go up for your entire life.  A mortgage is 25-30 years and you are owning the home outright, but the mortgage cost is partially offset by inflation. To do a realistic comparison you need to factor in interest rate fluctuations, inflation assumptions, rates on savings (without a doubling via pension contribution), maintenance, insurance costs, rent increases, moving costs.

How much did that 2009 build cost new? What is it's value today? What is it's projected value in 30 years?

And FWIW I am still a bit stuck on the fact that you are paying only £480 pm for a 2 BR home. That seems extremely low rent! This must be a subsidized rent situation. So, it might be unrealistic to assume that as a basis for long term stability. It might be limited increases for now, but as government resources are strained, will it stay that way? Will the government policy of a tax free lump from a pension sum stay that way? Will your housing subsidy be taken away at some point because of your pension size or other savings? These are all unknowns in the same way home price increases/decreases and inflation are unknowns. Personally I don't trust or depend on any government to secure my future well-being (or my children's) for the next 50+ years. So I work to protect our financial security independently as best I can.

Is buying better than renting?,Hot_Job6182,1,"I'll be one of the few who agree with you, particularly as you have such a great deal on rent. 

The pro housing crew seem to think that the only investment that can rise in value is a house, and that house prices can't fall. Both these assumptions are, of course, very wrong. They've been right for the last 25 years in relation to house prices rising but that doesn't mean they always will, and even over this period many investments would have beaten a house.

You could say shares are a far safer investment as they are more liquid and you can spread your risk. The only thing I'd say is that it may not make sense to put all your investments in your pension, where you can't touch them until you reach pension age. You could alternatively invest in your ISA, for example, and that also gives tax advantages as any gains or dividends are entirely tax free."

Is buying better than renting?,Illustrious_Dare_772,1,"Whilst it's just nice to look at the key financial data, what you must also take into account is your personal circumstances, if you are single with no children at the moment then renting and pumping as much as possible into a pension can be very attractive however if circumstances change and you become a couple and children are on the way later, you are then stuck in a position that pension money is untouchable until you reach retirement age. When you could be making decisions about needing more space or relocation to better school catchment area or quality of life for the family. 

When you reach pension age very few lenders are going to allow you to have a mortgage with them because your risk is too high, so unless you have enough to buy outright you may be forced to rent the other issue is £125k suddenly in the bank account the council is not going to entertain you in housing you and depending on your and potentially your partners health and social care needs when you reach pension age that money may be needed to cover other costs. 

The other factor with a pension is you are working on at the moment this is the one and only employer you are working for right up until you retire when you could change jobs and that employer uses a different pension provider basically locking the pot in at that ammount. 

Each have their merits and uncertainty, the key thing at the moment is to ensure you do have a decent emergency fund, because if your landlord decides to leave the rental game and sells up the property to the residential market you will be homeless whilst not immediately you will be left looking for another property to rent which could become cut throat if the pool of options to rent gets smaller. Or you may decide you do want to buy however the deposit becomes the issue, because savings have been pumped into something that cannot be drawn down from."

I own a house in London.

The main benefit of owning a property is not worrying if a landlord is going to kick you out. That is huge!

Once I've paid off my mortgage, the benefit is that I don't need to worry about interest rates anymore, as the interest rate which is out of our control, impact rent and mortgage amounts. It's a variable that is at the whim of the bank of england who can get it wrong. It can even go higher than the current rate. Who knows what will happen.

Pension is just paper money. Nobody knows what will happen in the future. Maybe financial crises will be more commonplace due to climate change. Who knows.

That was an article about Germany, so slightly different but the argument was that buying is a more emotional decision than a financial one (perceived stability and security, living something for the next generation, ...). But in reality you pay off that house for the next 30-40 years. Hopefully that's done by the time you retire, then you live in a 30-40 year old house that should be renovated (at least partially) with money that you might not have. Not considering all the curveballs live throws at you: divorce, needing accessibility when your old, ... alternatively you could put all you money in Stock, ETF, retirement savings, etc. And you probably have more money.

Is buying better than renting?,Coyltonian,1,"The miscalculation you have made is that in 30 years you are prolly still looking at a 25 year mortgage, not a 5 year one because house prices tend to increase over time. Good luck getting a lender to give you a mortgage if you are past 60 unless it will be paid off before your expected date of retirement. 

Additionally, your mortgage will (variable interest rates aside) remain pretty fixed over the term of the loan. Rents tend to move in one direction only; think of the film with the house tied to balloons!

Now sure we could get a couple of governments in the next 30 years to pull their fingers out and get some house building done which would stabilise or potentially even drop prices in that period. But it would have to happen pretty soon to have a meaningful impact over the period and relying on a government to do the right things is a pretty risky bet."
Is buying better than renting?,rubegonmega,1,"I think in your case it makes sense to keep renting at least for now.

I think your interest calculation is off too.  With a mortgage payment of 658, interest should be more than 300.  I think it’s closer to 500 at the beginning of the term, which is more than your rent.

I was looking for a house recently and decided to wait for this reason.  The interest part of my mortgage payment would have been more than the rent I’m paying, and house prices have been falling.  I decided I’m better off continuing to rent.

I can put the difference  in a savings account to save for a larger downpayment.  That’s equivalent to building more equity every month in the house I will later buy than I would if I were paying for a mortgage now.

The only way waiting works out worse is if house prices start to appreciate quickly all of a sudden and I miss out on the appreciation, which I think is unlikely for a while.

I’ll reassess in about 6 months.  We really want to live in a house we own, but not so much we’re willing to burn more money on interest than we are on rent."

It fails to understand maintenance costs of his magnitude would fall into the realm of yearly capital expenditure. It'd go towards increasing the value of his asset, so why it's lumped in with the dead money idk. The other obvious answer is the maintenance cost is massively overstated as countless have now calculated.

Your calculations are more correct - in a dead money Vs rent case, he'd be losing 170 a month. Let's say we have a yearly maintenance cost of £1k, so the dead money is £383 a month. He's still £97 down and this doesn't take into account the change in interest v capital as the years go on.

Is buying better than renting?,Angustony,1,"So many things wrong with this that I don't know where to start.

Bonds don't return 8% annually. If inflation increases (or just remains high) then your mortgage payment decreases in real terms, while rent would increase in line with inflation. Affordability checks take into account temporary unemployment, and if you're unemployed you can't pay rent either. Buying a house is a long term commitment. Temporary price drops are irrelevant and rent doesn't go down when house prices do, it continues to follow inflation - it rises. You can sell anytime you want, and usually at a profit. You pay utility bills renting or buying. If you're kids inherit your house they may have to pay some tax, but they inherit nothing if you rent. 

And on the plus side, in 20 years when your mortgage payments are the same as the day you took the mortgage out, you can choose to overpay without being financially worse off, and own it outright earlier, saving years of interest payments. Once you own your house outright you can never be homeless. You can modify and adapt your own home however you like, whenever you like. Once it's paid off you can cut your working hours, or take a low pay but enjoyable job and enjoy the same disposable income as before. You will never fear being made redundant. And/or you can boost retirement pension and savings to retire early. You will enjoy low expenditure for the rest of your life, which means higher disposable income. You can release the equity tied up in your home. You can downsize if you want, or you can just stay there. You can't be asked to vacate. I could go on..."

Once you own your house, ofcourse it's possible to loose it again. Take a scenario where you loose your job and have no income, had to take a pay cut, utilty bills went up, cost of living (less disposable income), you had no home insurance and a natural disaster happened, you get sued for something like causing a road accident or your spouse devorces you and you have to sell the house to cover the court case and pay their separation bill. You can go into a remortgage (If you have income) or equity release (when you don't. By the end of the term, they'll kick you out). Both circumstances mean you're paying the loan sharks again.
Ofcourse a home is a security that holds value, but it doesn't come without maintenance bills and in the mean time of being in a mortgage, you'll be paying the house off many times over at the present rates of interest. Many people who got themselves tied up in a long term commitment refuse to see the drawbacks of the deal and all in the business of real estate, from the banks to the solicitors to the real estate agents to the building contractors and property developers are all going to push the rosey dream pictures.

There's also the fact that it's very unlikely that interest rates will ever go down to the levels they had been for the past decade or so. Waiting for a return to the artificially suppressed interest rates of yore is probably a fool's game, honestly.

Honestly, in your case it may be better to save up your deposit while your rent is low and then look to buy when the mortgage interest rates come down and the renting prices go up.

I got my figures from moneyweek on a quick search
https://moneyweek.com/investments/investment-strategy/income-investing/604871/ftse-100-ten-highest-dividend-yields

Infact, in the turn of the 70s/80s some of the long term BoE Gilds (bonds) base (terminal) rates were reaching 16% (look up GB10Y in September 1981) because inflation was so high and I'm sure corperate bonds, being a little more risky that of the national bank, would have been offering higher interest (not to say that some didn't go bang). People were lucky that their wages were high relative to the value of property back then, so they only had to bear a mortgage for an average of 5 years, then it was paid off. My dad paid his off in 4 (4 bedroom detached, that he bought newly built for £27,500), on his wage alone. Things were different then. They'd have been in a dream world with a 7% mortgage repayment.

You are right in saying bonds are favoured for safer returns than equity in companies. You lock it in at the interest they offer and as long as the corperation stays solvent during when you're money is lent to them they'll give you all of it back at the end, and they'll pay that interest during the term. If the company goes into liquidation, they have to pay out to their creditors first before equity holders."

Is buying better than renting?,pelpotronic,-2,"Ok, what has changed since then?

Salaries have globally increased due to inflation, households now have several incomes (women now work), people are taking longer mortgages that cover their entire working life.

People will still need to pay for the houses. Do you think a bank will give you a mortgage for - say - 2M if you can't repay it?

And what would be the guarantee? Your pretty smile?

The only thing that may happen is you now indebt your children... But other than that, how and where do you think people will find money to repay their mortgage? You realise house prices aren't just made up numbers, and correspond to the reality of the wealth people can accumulate in a lifetime.

So how will people accumulate more wealth? My point is we are already at or near that cap, and there aren't many more creative ways to indebt households.

>The breakout point may be not within OPs lifetime seeing their rent increase is fixed at 3%, but why consider facts when it’s much easier to be an ignorant dick online? Lol

Except it is... 3% rent increase is pretty significant over time. I'm not sure how you're so ignorant to this concept.

With the numbers he put, in about 10 years mortgage interest + and his ludicrous 3% maintenance drops below rent, then after 25 his mortgage stops all together, meanwhile his rent is double what it is now.

I literally used the calculator he gave me and compared the two using his numbers, which to be fair had a ridiculously high percentage for house appreciation(although technically accurate to recent history), it did have some crazy numbers in rentings favour too. Buying left you £1.6million better off after 50 years, which is the average life expectancy after the average age to buy a house, no great surprise really.

It's basic maths. 

After buying, cost only goes down over time. With renting, cost only really goes up over time. The opportunity cost is pretty insignificant for your deposit, once you factor in the hugely higher investment contributions after just a short period.

You can call me a dick all you want, but all you've contributed is saying ""in short"" and then saying a bunch of things with no basis in fact.

In short, unfortunately you don't seem to know what you're talking about."

As long as they answered their insurance questions truthfully to the best of their knowledge then they will be fine to claim.  Lots of issues with houses go unnoticed for years before claiming. 

Nothing here is unusual"
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,1987RAF,60,"It sounds like you dodged a bullet.

Are you going to be a decent person and give them a copy of the survey so they can get this issue sorted? Im usually against giving whole surveys and would only insist that people only show the relevant page/s needed but the subsidence will be causing other issues.

Subsidence isn’t fun or cheap. If you have it treated through insurance usually there are so many hoops to have to jump through both before and after it really is one of the worst things to have to deal with."
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,itallstartedwithapub,24,"I can't see why an insurer wouldn't cover this if the current owners raised it with them now. Subsidence is rarely reported the moment it happens, since most people don't realise it's happening until there is significant enough damage to warrant investigation and monitoring. (But see my edit below). 

The blocked drains are something of a separate issue as that may not be covered by building insurance anyway.

There are some general principles (Domestic Subsidence Agreement) around which insurer is responsible for subsidence where the owner has changed insurer. They don't apply to changes of ownership, but they do state that issues reported more than a year after change of insurer are wholly the responsibility of the new insurer.

Edit: Perhaps they would decline if the subsidence was clearly long term and there was no previous survey - https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/decision/DRN5645627.pdf"
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,freexe,10,Subsidance isn't the boogyman it once was - the price to fix it has basically stayed the same for 40 years - while house prices have multipled way above inflation.

How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,AlpsSad1364,11,"I don't think any of the ""insurance will cover it"" people here have ever actually tried making a large insurance claim.

Insurance almost certainly won't cover it and definitely not if they didn't fill in their policy correctly and honestly. They will try to wriggle out of paying in any event (they have a whole department dedicated to this: loss adjustment) and the claim will be delayed and challenged at every step. If it's caused by blocked drains it probably won't be considered subsidence but water damage due to poor maintenance.

It's very much the seller's problem obviously and cynically you have to at least consider the possibility they were trying to flip it on the sly. If the subsidence was obvious on rightmove photos a level 2 survey would have picked it up (if it was just a valuation probably there wasn't even a site visit during covid).

I did feel sad for the owner a little bit as they’ll now need to declare the reason we pulled out was because of the high risk flooding marker (I was a bit remiss as didn’t look this up before offer in my defence though I had looked up houses on the street in the past and it had been fine the house we offered on is just one of 5 or so with a high risk on the street) - however the EA got shitty with me when I called and said we weren’t proceeding because of the flood risk - ‘there’s no rivers or water by the house how can it flood’ then sheepishly called me back and admitted the seller knew the car park that borders the house floods (government website shows this) but never the house or garden. 

So I’m less inclined to feel sorry for them now as they did know they were just hoping we’d sunk enough money into the purchase not to care by the time we found out.

Many of these same houses are back on the market today listed for the ridiculous amount they paid for them, going under offer and back to market over and over. I'm willing to bet that the offers are from people like us buying with a mortgage and getting down valued each time.

I ended up paying about 5k to repair it all, and the neighbour contributed 1k.

But all the drains, and my neighbours that feed above me are repaired and lined up to the main drain. Where I live it rains a lot, so money well spent.

It's wild how quickly all the damp issues cleared up for all the houses below us. It must have been going on for years!"

How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,AlpsSad1364,2,"Indeed. The partner of one of my friends had his house burnt down by someone who was staying in his spare room temporarily  (candle carelessness). His insurer wouldn't pay out because he didn't declare to them that he had a lodger (as specified in clause X , section 12.6, page 94 of the policy document that no one reads).

Unsurprisingly he couldn't afford to rebuild the house but bizarrely he managed to sell it at auction for more than the remaining mortgage so he in then end only lost his deposit (and all his worldly belongings).

Definitely pays to read the policy carefully and definitely do not even bend the truth. They will often make small payouts without argument for the reputational aura but have to make it back somewhere."

How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,Ratlee94,14,"Lmao, you're the one to speak... OP's post and responses are much more coherent than anything you presented in this thread."
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,npeggsy,1,"Surveys are weird. The buyer is expected to pay for them, but if issues come up like this, it's the sellers who are going to be screwed over and could really benefit from the information. If the onus was on sellers to provide a survey the current owners never would have bought the house in the first place, and OP wouldn't have got anywhere near this stage of buying the house. My mortgage required a specific structural survey after a level 2 (turned out the issue raised was a non-issue, great use of £400 for the further survey), so I sent the whole thing across just to evidence I wasn't being difficult for the sake of it getting more surveys done."
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,freexe,3,"I'm not that knowledgeable. My house moves a lot but doesn't have subsidence. A neighbours house along the terrace did have some subsidence and they have it horizontally piled to stabilise it.


The issue is you have to dig/drill pits all around your foundation and inject concrete/piles in to stabilise it. So that is very messy work and takes a little while and is expensive.


But it's on par with lots of other work you do when renovating. Certainly cheaper than an extension. The average cost in the UK is only £12,500.


It does have an impact on your house value, but probably way more than it should so bargains can be had. Not that I'd recommend it for a FTB."
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,HerrFerret,1,"Of course. However it wouldn't be worth the legal costs and the angry neighbour. And it isn't as easy as you would think.

He always 'denied any issues' at all times, even when asked point blank by environmental health. 

His house was always fine, so couldn't possibly be liable for the issues. How was he possibly supposed to know he was causing issues with all the other houses on the street.

I was lucky to get a contribution from him, which he paid monthly...."
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,banxy85,1,Wow crazy. And he couldn't argue that the person wasn't a lodger?
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,prof_UK,-3,"that's the business transaction. 

why would the buyer care about the ramifications for the vendor if they walk away, which they certainly will?

I don't understand what the OP is after and it's not clear what their intention is?

I think the vendor won't give two shits and will continue to sell it."
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,Twocaketwolate,1,"It's done like this to stop dodgy sales and people being led down the garden path or at least, being able to accuse the surveyor of working for the seller. 

I'd happily see it as a split thing mind. 

Buyer chooses who so its independent, seller pays if the report returns catastrophic matters such as subsidence, roof issues etc but the seller then gets given it to fix the issues. 

Something like that... Just off the top of my head."
How screwed is the seller after my discovery?,AlpsSad1364,2,"Apparently not. I mean, I know they wouldn't pay out, I assume he tried all the possibilities but it was before I knew him."

It's not really your problem as a tenant as it's not your responsibility to ensure the landlord has the correct insurance. All you need to insure as a tenant is your own possessions. 

It's possible that the agent is concerned about fire risk, as many policies forbid leaving items in shared areas due to risk of blocking escape during a fire. Or it could be the landlord doesn't have the correct insurance for renting part of their property. Either way not your issue but you probably do want to store things inside your rented space and keep your exits clear."

Help to Buy - Advice needed to rent/sublet property please.,CasualUKgamer,1,"Hi, had a hard battle. One person wouldnt accept landlord insurance without a letter for permission to sublet, something most landlord insurers dont cover! I insisted on speaking to their manager who said the letter wasn't needed if its landlord insurance. Its been 6 weeks of hell getting it through but finally sorted and looking at potential tenants later this week.  
  
I think when you're moving and you're on the help to buy scheme they assume you are moving temporarily and therefore will be renting, however at no stage during the process have I been asked if I am renting or buying next?  
  
EDIT: Feel free to ask any questions you need help with and I will try to help :)"
Help to Buy - Advice needed to rent/sublet property please.,cec91,1,Did you use landlord's insurance in the end?
Help to Buy - Advice needed to rent/sublet property please.,PinkStargazer,1,"They queried as he will be subletting his H2B propert and moving into my property which I own with a standard mortgage. For some reason they asked for my address and if I rent or own it, I was just trying to gauge why that would make a difference on wether they accept his application or not.. stressful as we are expecting a baby in a few months and would like to be legally living at my address! 

My husband just got a quote for landlords insurance via axa, the insurers themselves didn’t ask for the letter of permission to sublet.. glad you got it sorted though, good luck finding a tenant I’m sure it’ll be quick as rental properties are in high demand atm🤞"
Help to Buy - Advice needed to rent/sublet property please.,CasualUKgamer,1,"If help to buy insist on the letter (its not axa wont ask for the letter its H2B people that may - just insist its not necessary, I actually have an email from one of them stating its not necessary to provide the letter if I have appropriate insurance and that did work, so its not possible to make it work.

I am confused exactly when they asked for that information, they asked for the address I am moving to, I will be renting an annex in a house but the home address itself will be mortgaged if they checked. My advice is to call them and chat to them, emails take forever, at this stage you can ask what they need and understand why. Once I gave them all the information they asked for - application form, permission from mortgage provider, insurance and proof of extenuating circumstance its fine. Are they perhaps asking for more info to read into why he is moving? I cant think of another explanation."

Completion imminent. Have I forgotten anything?,SessDMC,4,"Get some replacement bulbs, a toilet block that goes in the cistern, carpet freshener (fabulosa foam carpet freshener is a good one), if you can get hold of a carpet cleaner that'd be better either buy or borrow but don't rent a rug doctor they're crap, gets rid of the musty smell if the house has been vacant for a while

When you're moved in get a boiler service booked in ASAP, if it's a non condenser boiler it might be worth looking into replacing it as you'll save some money on heating (and non condensing boilers are pretty old in general). Check when the fuse box and circuits were last tested, should be a sticker on the fusebox with the dates when it was last tested and when it's due.

Find your stopcock, usually under the kitchen sink, remember to turn the water on, run your taps and flush your toilet upstairs and look for any leaks, same for downstairs toilets and kitchen, it's better to find out before you settle in than finding out weeks or months down the line.

Of course all this advice is less likely needed if the house is newer, especially electrics but worth finding out as soon as you move in so you don't need to move stuff around as much and can get any issues fixed quicker or with less stress.

Edit: also check for smart meters and any in home displays, if you don't have an IHD check with your supplier who can tell you if your smart meter supports them and send you one out for free."

I was thinking the same thing when I moved in but it's a marathon, not a race so I'd still go round with the carpet cleaner and focus room by room rather than trying to do everything in one go, and as well you never know what might crop up, so far while doing the kitchen I've had a rewire done, plumbing done, ripped out the ceiling and replaced it, replastering and I haven't even built a cabinet yet. But hopefully it will be mostly done now by the end of next week.

Also don't solely rely on the survey on the electrics and just get them checked and tested in case there's any faults that need sorting out. When I got my fusebox changed out we found out 74 volts was running through one of the earth wires that our surveyor didn't see happening. 😂"

It's not vacant but there is a current rising damp issue that I have quotes for and have accounted for, so decorating will have to wait a bit, but besides that it's in good shape.

I do plan on at least considering the rewire since I'd like to provide more sockets to some rooms and the fusebox is dated to say the least. I did used to do electrics so I can use some kit to test it & make sure it's not going to blow up my sound system or anything.

On the brighter side there's a lovely fireplace with a fully functional chimney that's just had its stack repaired and serviced."

Once I've got the kitchen done (it was very dated and has no cooker or oven) I can relax a little and I'll have more room to move stuff around so I can focus on each room as I go.

Once I've done the bedroom and living room the next big job will be the dining room that is covered in artex, but it's the newer stuff that doesn't have asbestos in it at least so some X-Tex and a mess will clear it off, I'll also need to replace some of the ceiling cause like the kitchen the boards are bowing a little but thankfully the joists are fine (albeit I put wood hardener on it as a precaution while I had access)."

Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Worried_Patience_117,3,Why are you paying insurance on a leasehold house via a landlord?
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,rmas1974,2,Yes.  The offered price for the freehold is extortionate.  The value of the reversion in 1869 years is negligible and the only true value is the net present value of the £12 ground rent which would be under £500.  Could assert rights to manage and insure the building yourself so the insurance bill is excessive also unless there are high risks of some kind.
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,joobjoobfriend,2,"You must read the terms of your lease and who it makes responsible for insuring he property. Purchasing insurance via the freehold is inefficient as they will often inflate commissions and receive a kick back. You are able to ask what commission % is paid on the policy and there is recent spotlight from the FCA and ensuring fair value for leaseholders. If its anything more than 20% then arguable it is unfair. Your cover also sounds highly unusual being fire peril only, this is not common at all and poor value. I would seek out insurnace quotes online e if you have the time and use that to ask why the freeholder arranges such expensive and limited cover."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,jacekowski,1,"You need to work out value of 460k in 1869 years (to work out reversion value), with pessimistic (for you) values it will be approximately 0, then value of ground rent, again worst case scenario, 2.5k, some legal costs on top of that (for both sides, 1k-ish each) and you should be somewhere around 5k (and that is the pessimistic variant)"
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,"Because the landlord says it’s a legal requirement. They are required to insure the properties they own against a minimum of fire cover. My neighbour stopped paying the landlord when she got her own insurance much cheaper, and when she went to sell the house they made her pay all the backdated insurance before she could sell."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,"Thank you. I think they are being very unfair with their insurance provision. They are creating an unreasonable price because they have used a house value figure (provided by their surveyor) that is 3 x the market value (the usual metric for an insurance policy quote) of our home. In our purchase of full home insurance we provided the market value as required as the standard metric. In order to be protected by the legislation designed to protect leaseholders from ridiculous insurance policies like this, I have to meet the requirements of the landlord too - they will bat me off with ‘you have not insured it with an adequate rebuild house value’ - even though we have provided the standard market house value as is required. It’s very much a David and Goliath situation - the same family own most of the town. We can’t afford to challenge them, so see purchasing the freehold as a way of freeing ourselves, but even in providing a freehold quote they are brutal in their valuation! I can’t wait to be rid of them because the insurance and now the freehold are daylight robbery."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,Thank you
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Longshot318,6,Presumably your lease stipulates whether or not you are required to pay an insurance contribution to the landlord?
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,joobjoobfriend,2,"The value should be based on the reinstatement value (what it would cost to rebuild) and not the market value. This should be calculated by a professional rics qualified assessor and then there is no room for disagreement. I would definitely get some quotes online and show these to your landlord as evidence their terms are poor value. I would be more concerned that your cover only includes fire only. What if you have a major pipe leak or lightning, or malicious damage etc."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,RedditB_4,4,"You can’t hold different insurance policies on the same building. 

Absolute nightmare. Imagine the legal bickering if there was a fire and you had 6 different insurance companies all trying to worn out of paying anything by apportioning blame.

The freeholder is likely taking the piss with extortionate insurance rates.

He’s definitely taking the piss with his lease valuation. Thousands of year plus £12 ground rent = worthless. He knows it too.

He just wants a piece of the uplift you get if you secure it.

The process is arduous if go hostile for it so barter him down. Couple of grand plus his costs seems reasonable considering you’ll get roughly 1%+ on your value and increased saleability.

Just be sure to start a sinking fund if there isn’t one and you can self manage for extra bonus points."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,2,"Just checked the original lease which makes for an interesting read! It states ‘And further that the Lessor will during the said tern insure and keep insured the said messuage out-buildings and appurtenances and al other buildings (if any) which shall be erected upon the said demised premises agains loss or damage by fire in some Insurance Office in or near London for at leas three-fourths of the value thereof for the time being such value to be determined by th
said Surveyor’."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,"You’re right, I remember reading that. So what I should have said is that the rebuild is usually less value than the market value, so for our landlord to triple the market value to arrive at a rebuild value was so off the mark to everything I was researching re: value required for insurance purposes. And if we included the other risk storm etc they wanted over 2k. So we included everything in our home and contents for far far less, but they require us to have at least fire with them. Nearly everyone I know in this town has two insurance policies because of this landlord."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Longshot318,3,"You are correct about not having more than one insurance policy but the lease will stipulate whether that is to be taken out by the freeholder or the leaseholder.  This obviously relates to buildings, not contents insurance."
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,2,"I told the landlord insurance rep that I am extremely uncomfortable with ‘doubling up’ on insurance, because the irony was that for our home and contents it was cheaper overall to have fire included in the cover. I asked him what would happen in the event of a fire and he said we’d have to use their insurance - it is ridiculous especially as he is only able to offer building fire and storm damage insurance, so everyone has to buy further insurance to cover contents etc and effectively end up ‘doubling up’, but he told me ‘buy the freehold if you’re not happy’. I agree that saleability is a huge plus of owning the freehold, not least losing the hefty landlord insurance bill! The landlord owns most of the town so it feels very much a David and Goliath situation…"
Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,RedditB_4,2,"We had a live in freeholder once and she refused to insure the building despite the lease starting it was her responsibility.

Not much we could do. The flat owners weren’t organised. Didn’t speak much. Typical modern day life thing. 

To make matters worse the freeholder died soon after we acquired the place and our attempts to pick up where we left off organising the whole mess with her children fell flat. They were money grabbing little s**ts and the old lady had left behind quite the bag.

Tried taking us for 30k each for a freehold that was worth £0. It has nearly 950 years left to run at £20 ground rent per year with no provision for it to rise. Hardly investable.

Had to play hardball and force it from them and the tribunal set the price. I felt they were overly generous at setting the price at £300.  Worse still we’d offered £2k per flat plus their costs as a gesture of goodwill.

Greed people. Learn to see when you’re the guilty party and don’t be blind to the law when it’s an emotive issue. These kids (all in their 60’s) felt they were due more despite having it spelled out to them that they weren’t.

I didn’t lose any sleep."

"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",royalblue1982,13,"A bath tub should not be damaged by someone falling whilst having a shower? It sounds to me like it was poor work all round. 

I would honestly go back to the letting agent and tell them that given the information you've received about the quality of the install of the bath that you are only prepared to pay them for the value of the bathtub. Which, is unlikely to be more than £200. Tell them that the rest of the work is to rectify their own issues and standard wear and tear. 

However, also point out that they had a legal obligation to provide you with a working bath/shower during this period, or alternative accommodation. And as they haven't you will consider the £200 to be compensation, and hence you won't be paying them anything. 

The only reason they have the cheek of asking you to contribute towards this is because you haven't put up more of a fuss. If they want to go to court then so be it - you will win."

"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",LowButterfly744,4,"Landlord cannot benefit by making upgrades to the property at your expense. They can claim for a 7 year old bath (at best, it was probably older than that) and installation or repair costs for the bath only. Do not engage with any conversations about payment. Contact your insurance company and let them know what you communicated with the agency and confirm that you have not accepted liability for any payment. 
The worst the landlord can do is refuse to renew your contract in a year’s time, issue a Section 21 (but that process is LONG if you choose not to move out) or retain some of the deposit at the end of your tenancy - but you can just dispute that that based on the value of a 7 year+ old bath and basic installation costs, I can’t imagine that the deposit scheme will support a high claim."
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",SchoolForSedition,2,"If your insurance covered your damage repairs and you told the landlord, that’s what should have happened.

Chances are the landlord had either installed it wrong themselves, or bought the house with a discount to resolve these issues but never gotten round to doing it. Either way it’s their problem"
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",lukei1,1,"Fuck the landlord, this is why they have insurance, no?"
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",SliceTraditional5692,1,"Landlord here,  - I think your landlord is being a dick.

I think the most you should be expected to cover is replacement of a bath of similar quality, 

That would be the purchase and installing of the bath.  (so unfortunately you will be on the hook for the costs of a contractor - which can be much more than the materials)

Anything else is not your responsibility.

A good point is that your landlord should also consider the age and expected lifespan of the bath when deciding how much to charge you.  

Personally id say a decent bath should last 15 to 20 years (some may argue differently)   

So if the bath was brand new when you moved in 7 years ago (and we assume 20 years lifespan) you should only be asked to fund the remaining 13/20ths - 65% of the cost.  If the bath was super old, then that amount could become very small.

Your contribution should come from your secured deposit, and he has to justify that deduction to the deposit scheme.

The landlord should also hold insurance for the fixtures within the house so he can claim on that. I didn't even realise a tenant *could* have insurance for the fixtures"
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",zabradee,1,"I would also suggest that most of this is coming from the lettings agent and not the landlord. If you haven't seen the landlord then I can almost bet my life on it that they're long distance and the estate agent takes advantage of that.

I had a neighbour once whose landlord was in another country and the estate agents would do things like that. Going for expensive repairs and just sending along the invoice to the landlord. Even when the neighbour was responsible for the damage (broke several floor tiles in an argument with their partner), the estate agents got the landlord to pay for the repairs by retiling the whole floor. I really don't believe they'll pass that invoice over to you so I'd get all the evidence you need as I advised in another comment and wait quietly.

I don't think most of the people commenting are landlords and their advice is the typical advice of people who like taking advantage of the system. Estate agents rarely hound tenants for repair costs, it's more ""profitable"" for them to visit the burden on the landlord completely. They only do what's in their best interest and taking your side is in their best interest financially. 

Estate agents have never been on the side of landlords, but don't be a dick. The Estate Agents AND the contractor are both trying to make money. They could've installed that bath without the extra stuff. This is what they all do. The landlord most certainly isn't trying to get you to pay for a renovation in a property they do not live in, believe me."
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",Jakes_Snake_,1,"The agreed facts are you caused damage. 

The landlord is entitled to find their own contractor to complete the repair. They do not need to get authorisation. In such matters costs are only known when work is completed.

You question the cost as it seems to involve additional works that you consider would not be required.

But you haven’t got an invoice yet to see what you’re being charged for, which will explain what you need to pay for.

In short wait for the invoice."
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",Direct-Giraffe-1890,1,"If you've offered to replace through house insurance and they've declined and gone their own way with a contractor I wouldnt give them a penny.Youve offered to make good despite bath being sub par and they've declined,its now their problem."
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",KevCCV,-6,"Im sorry you had slipped, I hope you have no lasting injury.

Im also sorry to tell you, that your agency is likely to ask for the repair cost. Whether this is reasonable or not depends. But it does seems that you break it, you'd pay to fix it. (It should have been easier if you fixed it and pay without agency aware, anyway).

Im also sorry to tell you, I cannot see which insurer will cover you the cost, that you 'slip and break the bath' is not an insurable event.

Wait for the bill, then constest as you may."
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",itallstartedwithapub,2,"I agree that it's very unlikely a claim would be successful in court. 

You shouldn't have owed anything in the first place, baths shouldn't just fall apart. You/your insurer has been helpful in offering to pay something, which I think should be limited to the second hand value of the bath plus installation at most. That installation should have taken a day.

Now you've been without a bathroom for two months for reasons entirely secondary to the original issue - the landlord is updating the property whilst also receiving rent, a great deal for them. That they have the cheek to also ask you to find those updates is beyond ridiculous, and presumably happening because they suspect you might actually pay."
"Landlord renovating bathroom after accidental damage, how much are we expected to pay for?",zabradee,0,"Why would the landlord be responsible for finding them somewhere to bath if the tenant was responsible for damaging it? According to their report, the problem was the tile installation and not the bath. She's been bathing there just fine for 7 years. 

In my opinion, the landlord failed in taking so long to resolve the issue, I don't understand why it would take 2 months to start the work. There also should have been an agreement with who is contracted to do the work. It's the same if there was a car accident. Even if the other party is responsible for the damage, you can't bring a £5 million estimate for a job that can be done for £100. You will only get £100. 

Reddit thinks it's the landlord's responsibility to do everything, when realistically people should just stay living at home with their parents with this mindset. 

I would say get print-outs of the cost of baths and basic installation from a few contractors and wait to provide these/defend yourself if requested. If I have had a faithful tenant for 7 years, I wouldn't take a penny from you because I know how hard it is to get good tenants."

When is it appropriate to use trace and access insurance claim? ,DrDayalGhungroo,3,"Under your Aviva policy, you would have to find the leak and get it fixed yourself. If you have trace and access cover then it will cover you for costs to find the leak but not fix it. Most policies do not cover fixing of the leak. The actual insurance claim would come under Escape of Water.

If you have trace and access cover then normally it will cover any damage caused to your property to find the leak. Just note that trace and access will have a limit as per most things on your policy. 

If you haven't done anything wrong and you haven't deliberately let the damage occur or get worse over time without doing anything to mitigate it, then you have nothing to worry about. You don't need to worry about saying the wrong thing. 

The only thing you can do is get a second opinion but really the real costs won't be known until the leak is fixed and damage to your property is assessed in full. 

If you have any questions let me know and good luck!"
When is it appropriate to use trace and access insurance claim? ,seukexpat,1,"Thanks for the response. I looked up the Aviva policy and it states:

Tracing and accessing leaks
If your home has been damaged by a water leak, we’ll pay reasonable costs to remove any part of the internal structure of the home needed to find the source of the leak. We’ll also make good after the leak’s been fixed.
We’ll ask you to pay to repair or replace the leaking pipe or part if it had simply failed or worn out. This is because your policy doesn’t cover wear and tear. We’ll only pay to repair the pipe or part if it’s damaged by something which your policy covers (e.g. accidental damage, if applicable).

My question on the policy is what is included in the ""We'll also make good after the leak's been fixed"". What does that mean exactly? Let's say we needed to pull up all the tiles in the bathroom and they weren't salvageable and needed to be replaced, that would be covered -- but the charges directly associated with fixing the leak would not? Do I have that right?"
When is it appropriate to use trace and access insurance claim? ,DrDayalGhungroo,1,"You have that spot on mate. So any damage caused to find the leak such as lifting flooring, tiles, or cutting a whole in a wall to repair the leak, etc would be covered.  What's not covered are the costs involving getting the leak repaired. This can be plumber costs, call out charges etc.

Also under your policy, they would not look to confirm cover until you provide a report from your plumber which confirms there was a leak, it was fixed, what was done to fix it etc and photographs of the damage from the leak to your property and after the plumbers been so they can effectively validate what you've said has happened.

So any damage caused to find the leak is only  covered if they establish under your policy that an insured event has taken place."
When is it appropriate to use trace and access insurance claim? ,seukexpat,1,"Thanks for the followup! So just to confirm, there's no need to file a claim before I have leak detection specialists come out and determine where the leak is coming from (covered), fix the leak (not covered), and then make good (covered)? I can file the claim afterward if the costs become beyond what I'm willing to pay out of pocket using the itemized invoice from the plumber?

Thanks!"
When is it appropriate to use trace and access insurance claim? ,DrDayalGhungroo,2,"Yes that is correct mate. If you’re going to have leak detection come out then I highly recommend you take photos of the damaged areas in your property now, when they attend (photographing any damage they may cause) all through to until the pipe is fixed. 

Get a report from the leak detection specialist and plumber so that if you do wish to claim, you can provide the reports to Aviva who will outright confirm if your policy covers you for a claim, what’s covered and what is not. 

I have quite a lot of experience in these things so if anything isn’t clear then don’t hesitate to ask mate. Now or even later!"
When is it appropriate to use trace and access insurance claim? ,seukexpat,2,Hugely appreciated! Thanks for giving me the confidence to deal with this.

"Update: Lodger refused to leave. Police refused to engage in a ""civil matter"", and I was made homeless.",roxieh,356,"What the fuck. This guy is mental.

I'm so sorry, what an absolute nightmare. In what way is his fake rental agreement signed by you? Has he forged your signature? Presumably your mortgage is not a buy to let one, which adds weight behind the faked rental agreement. 

This sounds like it will probably be incredibly messy and involve solicitors and a court order. Not at all what anyone needs. Fuck this guy, holy shit.

I would be going to the papers with this, and also writing to your MP, petitionng the local council and contacting a solicitor / lawyer to prepare for a court battle. This is insane. And definitely news worthy."
"Update: Lodger refused to leave. Police refused to engage in a ""civil matter"", and I was made homeless.",swappinhood,101,"Where in the UK are you? I read through all your posts and comments and this situation is infuriating me.

To be clear:

1. You are in the right legally, the lodger is breaking the law by making threats and refusing to leave. You are allowed to have a lodger as part of a residential mortgage so you haven’t done anything wrong. 

2. Unfortunately, the law doesn’t enforce itself, the police does that. Given that they won’t help you, you need to take matters into your own hands as much as possible. As some others have suggested, arrange for a locksmith to arrive when you know he will be gone, have the locks changed back, and throw his shit out. Have some friends over to stay with you for the time you expect him to return.

3. As someone else of Chinese descent, I’ve noticed that law enforcement and public officials sometimes don’t typically treat me nor my Asian friends as they do with my non-Asian friends, so you’ll need community support, especially since you’re not fluent in English (even though your English is very good!). If you’re near London perhaps I can help.

4. In the meantime, communicate to the lodger regarding his immediate eviction, so you have written evidence you’ve attempted to evict. You won’t get the eviction process started without it.

5. See if you have friends or contacts working in the local newspapers or media, perhaps try contacting them or even the daily Mail, the Daily Mirror, or some other tabloid tip lines - your story would gather media attention and open your options for help.

Do you have friends or family in the area you can rely on?

> The police sided with the lodger and informed me I would have to find alternative accommodation.

> Upon returning to my property after a couple of days I discovered my keys no longer work, so it appears the lodger has changed the locks.

This can't be real. So who is paying the mortgage? Why didn't you show this to the police? This is crazy. You need to go back to the police and show them relevant paperwork and prove you are the homeowner and have no signed any tenant contract. What the heck."

"Update: Lodger refused to leave. Police refused to engage in a ""civil matter"", and I was made homeless.",TheWritingCompSci,37,"I'm extremely sorry and disgusted that this is happening to you. 

According to the Crown Prosecution Service [website](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/forgery-and-counterfeiting), forging your signature on a tenancy agreement in order to convince people (in this case, the police) that he is a tenant rather a lodger is against the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981. As far as I am aware, this is a criminal offence.

As other posters have suggested, I also think you should visit your local MP's office as soon as possible and consider contacting the press too, highlighting that you have been blackmailed, evicted from your own property, and have been the victim of forgery and that the police refuse to help, despite forgery for this purpose being a criminal matter. Before contacting the press though, you should check with the lawyer to ensure doing so won't negatively affect your situation even further.

With regards to the police response, I would also make a complaint to the [Independent Office for Police Conduct](https://www.policeconduct.gov.uk/complaints-reviews-and-appeals/make-complaint) because you told them that your signature had been forged and they did not investigate it."

It's mad that you might have to prove that this is your sole/primary residence, but I assume your mortgage is not a buy-to-let one, all bills are in your name, your bank account etc are all registered at this address, and that you have no other rented or owned residence?"

If the police won’t do their jobs - state you want to report the fraud associated with the fake contract and request a crime number.

I’d also esculate it further to your MP, take all evidence (including the crime number) and go full throttle.

Hopefully the lodger can have some nice new digs of their own…. In prison."

"Update: Lodger refused to leave. Police refused to engage in a ""civil matter"", and I was made homeless.",Nemisis_the_2nd,13,"I saw the other post when you put it up. I didn't have high hopes for the police to resolve the situation immediately, but it sounded like you had a good case for them to forcefully remove the person within a day or so.

(I apologise, but the rest of the comment is going to be a little disjointed) 

At this point, I'd probably **escalate this to your local MP**, and possibly the press, but would probably check in with the solicitor before you do the latter. It might also be worth looking into getting a lawyer. In the case of a lawyer, the UK has a system of legal aid, where most legal offices will provide some level of free services, so I wouldn't worry too much about the costs, at least to start with. 

You also have the blackmail to consider.

If you haven't already got one, make sure you have a crime report number too. Detail everything you can in it. This is useful for the police, as it gives them a case to work with, and can also be passed onto your MP and any legal experts dealing with it, in case they contact the police too.

You mentioned the home insurance working with a solicitor. It might be worth trying to speak to the solicitor directly, and getting advice from them. Take whatever they say over reddit advice. 

I'm going to be honest though, I'm not sure what else can be done in this situation. The police have screwed up massively, and anything you do yourself will likely make you a target for them too.

Edit: I just saw the comment saying you have the ashes. At least that's one small mercy on this whole mess."

I can only think of getting a lawyer involved. This could have been fixed so quickly if the police just did their job & protected vulnerable people but they didn't.  I'm not even sure how to do it.

Really really common thing. 

They break in quick, and then law protects them for no reason. They don't even need a contract there, sometimes they just order some pizza delivery, show online orders, or simply, never leave the house. If you don't catch them quick enough (I think it's 24 or 48h, not sure the legal term), they are considered residents there and can't be evicted easily.

Even then, they just don't leave. They order online, and get bunkered, making a mess of the place during their stay, which in some places has been months and years.

As last resort, or even first resort for some and more common lately, people hire gypsies or some rough people to go in and give them a fucking scare to kick them out.

OP, your insurance have the resources to sort this out, and the policy places obligations on them. The policy booklet and schedule are your bible now.

It's a very good idea to keep comprehensive, well organised records of everything you spend, all correspondence, all phone calls etc. just in case you are asked to provide evidence later on.

I’m getting a lodger,xParesh,107,"**Edit: I just want to advise other potential live-in landlords looking to rent out their spare room, yes legally it's your property and your home and your rules but your lodger is a human being too who is also looking for a home. It irritates me no end seeing so many financially desperate accidental desperado landlords offer up their spare room up for lodging with zero regard for the human being they are lodging to.**

If you prefer your lodger to be not even be seen let alone heard and are just looking at getting into the business for the ""easy"" money, then being a live in landlord is just not for you. My advice is just get a second job instead, I hear Deliveroo are always looking for drivers and cyclists. Having a lodger is not an easy gig to free money.

I've had a lodger for almost a year. Here are my tips.

\- Tip No 1. Imagine you woke up no longer the landlord but the lodger tenant, having swapped bodies and circumstances. **How would YOU like to be treated?** That's an excellent place to start! **Do to others only how you would like to have done to you.**

\- Think about how comfortable you'll be sharing your home and personal space with a stranger. Even from the outset I was totally fine with it and its worked for me but other (desperate) landlords struggle and it can cause tensions later.

\- Make sure you pick a lodger you feel you have chemistry with and will be happy to live with. I found getting the right lodger to be the most difficult part. It wasn't even about the money (which was nice to have but not needed in my case), it was just about having someone occupy my home when I was out and about and providing a home to someone who really needed it.

\-You should draw up a basic lodger contract. You could put in just one weeks notice. I had a break clause in mine. I set it up for 3 months minimum with a 1 week break clause in that time - ie if we found the situation wasn't working out, either party could give 1 weeks notice to leave without fault. After 3 months it became a rolling contract with 1 months notice.

\- Cleaning. I work from home but the lodger doesn't. My lodger is clean and considerate but I still like to wipe the surfaces down, do the hoovering, empty the bins and turn on the dishwasher myself. I ask my lodger to keep the kitchen/living room clean but I then give it an extra clean to meet my OCD standards without penalty to my lodger. I think this is a bug bear for a lot of co-habiting people who have different standards. I could hire a cleaner but in my case it didn't make sense when there was so little to clean and I could do it all myself.

\- Kit out his room well. Mine has a nice TV, desk, chair, wardrobe, mini fridge and kettle for his cups of tea and pot noodle. Mine spends a lot of time in his room so equipping it well just makes it a little more cosy and self contained and it just means you have the rest of the house more to yourself more often if that works better for you.

\- Be clear about overnight guests. Mine had his sister over a few nights which was fine. Then his GF started coming over. Eventually she moved in and I raised the rent by £100/month more to cover it. I would not have considered a couple at first but in our case they are very discrete and haven't caused me any trouble so I was OK with it. In fact I'd definitely consider a couple again in future as my experience has been positive.

Overall, my situation is proving to be a win-win for all parties. All the rental income is just going towards overpaying the mortgage to chip it down from the 33yr term it is today to hopefully something within my lifetime. 

Its important to have the right attitude and expectations going into this. **Its your home but you want to make sure your lodger is comfortable and you're compatible**. We call each other flatmates because that is how we operate. I dont landlord all over them and know from my long experience of renting how I'd like my ideal landlord to be so Ive taken that approach."
I’m getting a lodger,[deleted],108,"Get all the info from spare room. Use their lodger agreement templates as well so you have an agreement written down and signed. Take a deposit. Don’t believe you need to do a tax return at £100 a week, I didn’t when I had a lodger."
I’m getting a lodger,elrip161,40,"Get references for the lodger. Unfortunately there are some predatory people who pretend to be lodgers who are targeting you. Cuckoos mainly target older landlords living on their own. You’ll want at least a verifiable employer’s reference and ideally a personal one such as from a previous landlord, though that’s not always possible.

Fortunately (for you) lodgers don’t have the same level as protection as normal tenants. You don’t need to give them a long notice period if you want them to leave, and you don’t need to go to court to get them evicted. If things don’t work out you can give them ‘reasonable’ notice to leave, and then just change the locks.

Unless you trust them a lot after living with them a long time, don’t leave the property for extended periods. I know someone who went abroad for a holiday and came back to find the lodger had posed as the owner and illegally rented out the entire property to a family of strangers, then disappeared with thousands of pounds. They had a fake AST but the landlord was effectively homeless because he couldn’t just evict them now. He’d had that lodger for only 6 months.

If they can’t supply verifiable references, don’t let them live with you. That landlord hadn’t got any references, he just found the guy on Spareroom and felt he was trustworthy.

You’re not required to protect a lodger’s deposit as you are with normal tenants, but don’t just assume it’s your money. Definitely charge one, though, just so you’re covered if anything is damaged or goes missing.

Related to that, get an inventory of everything in the room drawn up and include it in their lodger agreement. Ideally don’t put any furniture you’re attached to in their room. It’s surprisingly common for lodgers to ‘forget’ what belongs to them when they move out. And be there when they do, ‘helping’, just so that doesn’t include the bed frame (as happened to another landlord I know).

You need to do a tax return if you earn over £1,000 from non-taxed sources a year, but as you won’t be making £7,500, you can claim the rent a room relief which means you won’t pay any tax."
I’m getting a lodger,rich_b1982,11,"You ideally want to have a written agreement that both have you signed as that at least sets out the basic terms of the agreement.

Also just something to say that the place is your main home and that you are there as a resident landlord - mainly in case anything does happen and you need evidence of that.

Not sure if you're on a mortgage, but sometimes you are expected to seek your lenders consent. Likewise if the person is liable for council tax and you've been getting a single person discount, you'll need to cancel that."

I’m getting a lodger,InternationalFly7717,5,"We had lodgers at our last house and on the whole it was a positive experience - two have become life long friends and one in particular we'd class among our best friends now. That said I'd caution against having a lodger who is someone you already know as if things go south it causes even more trouble - our first ever lodger was a friend of my boyfriends, didn't take long before she started getting behind on rent, not going to work, wanting to pay less even though we were already charging below market rate. Asked her to leave after I was told she had been seen in a club trying to buy drugs at the same time she was pleading poverty to me and her work were ringing the house asking where she was. My boyfriend lost his best friend over that situation because his girlfriend claimed I was being a b*tch for kicking her out.

Funnily enough our last ever lodger was the only other problematic one. She'd asked if she could have pet chinchillas and I said that was fine (we love animals). Again after a couple of months she started being less considerate - constantly bringing different men home, bought a huge air conditioner for her room but refused to pay extra for the electric bill etc. She eventually decided to move back in with her mum and I was devastated when I went in the room as everything had been chewed by the chinchillas including the walls and a chest of drawers which was the only thing I had that belonged to my Grandad who passed away before I was born. Turned out she'd been letting the chin's out of the cage and leaving them in the room unattended, when I asked her to pay for damage repair she said, and I quote, 'You shouldn't have left anything in the room if you didn't want it damaged'. All in all cost me about £1000 to get repairs done and the drawers will never be quite the same.

So lessons I've learnt and things I'd do differently in future:
- no lodgers I already know
- if allowing caged pets insist they're supervised while out of the cage and check the room every now and again to make sure 
- guests fine but tell lodgers limited to x number of nights per week/month, if they want someone to stay longer that can be open to negotiation for additional money
- full rent up front for the week/month ahead so as not to get in arrears
- reasonable bills included but extra costs to be paid if they start using things excessively or buy something which consumes a huge amount of energy

Overall it was a positive experience for the years I did it and I'd be happy to do it again if I find myself in need of additional finances. It might not match other people's experiences but I found the most considerate and reliable lodgers were men in their 30's and most problematic were 18-25 year old women (I was a woman in my 20's)."

I'd set your kitchen cleanliness standards early on.  It might also be worth while increasing the rent a little and using the difference to get a cleaner in fortnightly.

I think also make sure to get someone that needs to sleep at night to get up for work the next day so that they don't completely destroy your sleep schedule and decide on whether bf/gf sleepovers are ok or not and to what extent.

It could include stuff like how much the rent is, how big a deposit has been given, what the notice period is etc. You can fill in the numbers yourself. It might also be a good idea to stipulate which rooms the lodger has access to (for example their bathroom but not your bathroom) & which communal areas you're okay with them using.

I \*could\* ask for more, but I'd rather it be cheap and lodge with people I like than go to the open market.

Things I've learned - cleanliness, I encourage clean as you go but the reality is sometimes different, if it bothers you, just agree to split a cleaner on top or do it yourself.

If your lodger drives, being able to help each other with lifts is a result.

We split cooking and food shops between us. Works well, but I've also made shelf space and done separate shops, just need to co-ordinate cooking time and cleaning your kitchen items.

Incidentals - loo roll, kitchen towel, cleaning products etc. - I split these as we both use.

Guests - no dramas here, week, long weekends fine.

Insurance - varies by provider. I cover his in-house contents incase of fire/theft, but not away from property, and previously have had a partner get separate contents due to the value of jewellery/watches etc, so contents only policies are available.

Furnished/part furnished - my setup is 80% furnished, current lad has added some lamps and shelves but that's pretty much it. Big TV included in the lounge/office space, desk, chair, sofa, bed, wardrobe. Basically just add bedding, clothes and you're good to go.

(You could’ve looked online to see how much people charge for similar spaces or ask an estate agent to have a look and give an estimate/value.

A tenancy agreement really should be signed by both parties before anyone moves in.
Eg if they’re late / short with the rent for 3 weeks in a row, or they start smoking, or they decide to get a pet that spoils your carpet or they bring ppl in at all hours of the day and night, or they damage your furniture, what are you going to do?

There is no tenancy agreement saying what you can or will do, ie what the consequences will be. 

There are tenancy rights and laws of course so having your terms in writing and SIGNED by yourself and the tenant is ideal, as some things could be seen as reasonable tenant conduct, even if you don’t agree with it.

Maybe you could look up tenancy agreements for lodgers online, or ask an agent and fill in the blanks to your fit specifications then get the tenant to sign it.

A property inventory could also be a good idea (where a clerk comes in and analyses the good / bad condition of the room/s before, and after a tenancy, before or after the tenancy).

You and the tenant then get a report back with descriptions and photos, which you and the tenant read through and sign if you agree with it.

It acts as evidence in case anything is damaged or stolen, it also protects the tenant eg if a landlord makes a genuine mistake and believes something belongs to them, and the tenant disagrees, then you’ll both have the inventory to confirm who things belong to BEFORE they embarrass themselves ☺️

If you don’t get that done professionally, no problem (it’s not a legal requirement) but then definitely at least take clear photos of the room, contents and condition of items, furniture, hard flooring, carpets, walls, ceiling, wardrobe, windows, curtains and blinds etc.

I’m getting a lodger,51wa2pJdic,2,">a resident landlord

An **owner** occupier.

Landlord and resident is not sufficient, they have to own the property too (for exemption from being HMO with up to 2 lodgers).

Obviously usually the case (landlord is owner) but occasionally commonly not (eg a person rents a whole property and sub rents rooms to 2 lodgers - they are landlord to their lodgers and they are resident but it is an HMO)."
I’m getting a lodger,Caliado,2,"Thats not a solid reason for the tenant from their perspective to pay as high or higher deposit than one that gets protected and administered through a relatively independent scheme.

No one who you are trying to rent the room to is going to go ""well this room has a higher deposit and it's not protected but the landlord has risk of theft so I'll agree to it"" they are just going to pick a different housing option if available (even if they acknowledge the risk is higher it's just not their problem. Like, I also think it's immoral to do but it is also just impractical as it's a massive drawback of the thing you are selling so it needs to be priced accordingly or people will just go for a different option without the big drawback)

And it works both ways the deposit needs to be low enough to be worth the risk of the live in landlord pocketing all of it for no reason and the tenant having much less route for recourse.

The solution that solves both party's issues is probably requiring live in landlords to protect deposits same as live out ones though."

Particularly with a FTB who is as on it as you are - wouldn’t want to lose that!

As someone else said, definitely don’t arrange for a survey now, as it won’t speed up things, and probably tell the solicitor to hold fire too. But do check in with the EA regularly and clarify whether they definitely are looking to tie in a purchase or what their situation is. Some EAs aren’t very proactive / good at communicating and in my case, I have the main agent I instructed with the sale but also two of his colleagues showing people round who seem clueless and the communication between them is a little.. haphazard.

Insurance company delays possibly causing more water damage ,itallstartedwithapub,3,"Is this a home emergency service through your insurance? If not, they'll have assumed you have already fixed the actual issue, and will be visiting to assess the damage. If it is a home emergency service, they should be attending the same or next day - and this should be clear in your policy.

But, insurance aside, surely you would call a plumber yourself before moving out or leaving it to get worse for 3 weeks?"
Insurance company delays possibly causing more water damage ,Less_Mess_5803,2,"Call a bloody plumber! Leave it for 3 weeks and watch the insurance company wash their hands of any damage as you didn't do anything to halt it.  If you have home emergency get on the phone!  Insurance isn't a fix it policy, read the small print. The onus is still on you to get it fixed and claim if necessary. 3 weeks of water damage could cost you thousands and thousands if you leave it!"
Insurance company delays possibly causing more water damage ,unpredictable90,1,No it’s not a him emergency service just normal home insurance. They asked on the phone if we had fixed it and we said no (as we had only just discovered it) and they then advised they would send someone out to inspect the cause and damage who would also fix it…that’s why we never got a plumber and was surprised by the length of time when we got confirmation of booking text in. The leak is a very slow drip from the side of the tap so we have stopped it getting on the floor or anything by wrapping a towel around the tap and not using it.
Insurance company delays possibly causing more water damage ,unpredictable90,1,"I am not sure how these things normally work but please note: 

1. We have stopped the water leaking onto floor by wrapping a towel around the tap (it is a very slow drip from the side of tap).
2. We phoned the insurance company immediately when we discovered it (well first thing in the morning as was middle of night) and they asked us if it was fixed - we told them it wasn’t so they are aware. 
3. The insurance company said they would send someone to inspect the cause and the damage and they would repair it (so thought it was sorted at that point). It was only when we got a message to tell us when the appointment was that I was surprised as I thought it would be within a day or so."
Insurance company delays possibly causing more water damage ,itallstartedwithapub,2,"Your priority should be fixing the leak.

Reimbursement of costs will be down to whatever your insurance policy says - minus any excess. For a minor leak I would think it's not worth claiming in most cases due to the excess."
Insurance company delays possibly causing more water damage ,Less_Mess_5803,1,"Get back on the phone to them, they cant expect you to be without water for 3 weeks. in the meantime have a look at your policy and find out what you are covered for. 
Whilst insurance is handy sometimes it's worth paying for the trade to just fix it rather than having a claim on your policy and then paying increased premiums. Depends on the extent of damage though."
Insurance company delays possibly causing more water damage ,unpredictable90,1,"Thanks will do that. If I pay for someone to fix it, would I then just be able to claim back the cost (assuming it exceeded excess / was worth it) ?"

Struggling to pay flat bills and living pay check to pay check?,Aetheriao,7,"400 mortgage on 26k is not a problem while single so your income isn’t the issue, your spending is. 

Assuming no student loan and a basic 5% pension you have 1780 or so a month. 

400+136+100 for all your major household bills and mortgage is only 636.

If you’re living pay check to paycheck on 1150ish a month as a single person then your spending is out of control. That’s 265 a week or 38 a day.

It’s likely a combination of a car more expensive than you can manage and your debts slowly sinking you. 

The easiest way is to track all spending in a spreadsheet and log it all for an entire month. And all of it. If you spend 1 quid on gum record it. Because often issues like this are deaths by a thousand cuts where you’re missing many small spends. Average all bills out per year and add it to this monthly total as not all bills will be monthly so make sure you include everything. 

Break it down into groups (car/travel, food, personal items, social events etc) and look where the hole is. This can be really eye opening if you tend to spend a little often as it’s easy to not realise how much it’s adding up to. 

You don’t list the cost of your car or optional bills like internet. But make sure you’re actively chasing good deals. It’s easy if you leave it for it to rise and slowly eat away at your income if you don’t shop around.

But 400pcm on a mortgage is very low and you should not be pay check to pay check on that type of living cost at 26k. The issue is you have to still be very mindful about spending as it’s very easy to spend 20-30 quid here and there until you’ve spent half you take home as your overall income is still lower.

Realistically for anyone to help you need to list all bills (insurance/car/debt/food/internet/phone/fuel/Netflix etc etc) so it’s clear what discretionary spending you have left. Step one is working out if you have too many monthly outgoings that need to be cut as you have little discretionary spending, or if you have plenty and you’re spending it mindlessly without realising. Because the solutions to both are very different. But it’s so important because eventually the property will drop a bill on your lap and then you will be in trouble. Even small savings a month will keep you above water until your salary rises over time."
Struggling to pay flat bills and living pay check to pay check?,[deleted],2,"Your take home is \~£1800 a month. The listed costs are £689 so unless your car and credit cards are massive payments you should easily be able to save money.

On less than £1800 a month in the past i've run my entire household including 3 kids, wife and 2 cars without going into debt and always had money for frivolous things.

One thing to go is internet or phone. You don't need unlimited data if you're at home most of the time and you don't need internet if you have 5g unlimited on your phone.

I pay £10 a month via giff gaff, use my phone every break time at work and use it via wifi when at home. Never use more than 2GB data."
Struggling to pay flat bills and living pay check to pay check?,DirectionRealistic55,3,Have you called the council to see if council tax can be reduced? I remember paying 1/3 less of what I was supposed to when I was living alone/was the only one paying the council tax in a property.
Struggling to pay flat bills and living pay check to pay check?,[deleted],1,"You're not on much more than minimum wage, so you've done well to have purchased a property esp by yourself.

You're aware of the phone contract, if it's 5g or strong 4g with unlimited data you could probably do away with dedicated Internet connection too, then just hot-spot to tv/laptop 

Get your credit card paid off ASAP, then just concentrate on increasing income, most likely by switching jobs."

Without all the figures it's hard to calculate where you could potentially save some money.

Sorry I know that's not overly helpful, we started doing one big food shop a week as opposed to lots of small ones and we saved loads per month. We do online click and collect for food now and that stops us impulse buying stuff just because we see it.

Also it's really great that you have an asset at 29, and your best bet is to reduce car costs etc because they don't appreciate but the value of your property should"
Struggling to pay flat bills and living pay check to pay check?,royalblue1982,1,"When I moved into my first house I had budgeted that I would have about £300 a month left once id' paid all my bills and bought essentials. Then my car broke down in the first month and I had to take out a loan, leaving me with £120 a month left after everything else. The 2 years I spent with only that amount really encouraged me to think about how I spent every pound!

Look, your take home pay should be about £1850 and with a £400 mortgage you would normally be fine. The fact you're not is a reflection of the choices you've made regarding your car and credit card history. Until you've sorted that out you'll need to live on a budget similar to what I did. It's a bit miserable at times - but at least you've got your own place."
Struggling to pay flat bills and living pay check to pay check?,vitryolic,-2,"Can you do a side hustle in the meantime to increase your income? Deliveroo, Uber, selling stuff on Vinted, crafting things on Etsy etc. 

All your expenses sound reasonable so it’ll be difficult to cut what is already low. Do you need the car? Could you get a bike or public transport? That’d be a large expense reduced."

Not all loft boards can take the weight of an adult, they're designed to have weight spread across them, in other words not really designed to walk across of them in between the joists. The engineer should know this, I've been doing it years and know what boards I can and what boards I can't walk across. If the engineer has just carelessly walked through the loft workout first checking then it's on him. If however the boards are proper flooring grade chipboard and just installed wrong, the engineer has a valid argument that he has taken care but the accident was unavoidable due to poor installation of the loft boards."
"Gas Engineers broke the ceiling, who should pay for the repair?",mtrun,1,"Yes, the loft is boarded and has floors. Yes, he said his foot snapped a wood and caused the damage."
"Gas Engineers broke the ceiling, who should pay for the repair?",mtrun,1,"Yeah, fortunately no one is injured. The gas engineer seems fine and has already back to his works."
"Gas Engineers broke the ceiling, who should pay for the repair?",WG47,1,"Sounds like either the flooring isn't thick enough for people to walk on - intended only for storing some light things - or the flooring's compromised in some way. Maybe a leaky roof or something?

Either way, I don't think it's the gas engineer's fault that the floor couldn't hold the weight of a person. You're lucky he's not claiming for injury etc tbh."
"Gas Engineers broke the ceiling, who should pay for the repair?",mtrun,1,"I am glad that no one is injured indeed.

Out of curiosity, if a builder/engineer was injured during their work, shouldn't their own insurance cover the this kind of accidental injury?"
"Gas Engineers broke the ceiling, who should pay for the repair?",WG47,2,"He'd claim on his insurance, but then they could potentially pursue you for it."
"Gas Engineers broke the ceiling, who should pay for the repair?",mtrun,1,"Anything I can do to protect myself other than hoping I am dealing with honest builders/engineers?

I mean if this did cause injuries, then it is reasonable to claim. But I know this didn't cause any major injury to him. Do they have any legal ground to claim anything major from me, especially after they already claimed their own insurance?"
"Gas Engineers broke the ceiling, who should pay for the repair?",WG47,2,"I really wouldn't worry about it. If he's fine, he'd be committing insurance fraud by claiming in the first place. If anything does come of it, contact your insurance."
"Gas Engineers broke the ceiling, who should pay for the repair?",mtrun,1,That's rest reassuring. Thanks for your advice.

Mortgage protection meeting,Apple22Over7,3,"If its anything like the protection meeting I had today with my broker, it'll be talking you through the details of life insurance, critical illness cover and income protection insurance. On my meeting, the broker went through the various options, how they worked, what they covered and what they likely wouldn't, what they'd pay out and for how long, and crucially, an idea of what they'd cost.

There was no pressure, and the broker made it clear that any and all of the insurances offered were optional and not mandatory in my case (although some lenders insist on life insurance as a condition of the mortgage). He's now left me with a load of information to consider and do my own research on before making any decision on what if any insurances I want to take out.

Ultimately the broker will get a kickback if I take out any policy with him, but the call wasn't a hard sell at all."
Mortgage protection meeting,[deleted],2,"Other reply you got is good. 

Also nobody needs insurance until something bad happens to them. Once you’re already sick you cannot insure against it. Sadly 50% of people will get cancer in their lifetimes. If you get it whilst you still have a mortgage I’d assume you’d wish you had insurance. It won’t be fun trying to pay whilst recovering."

Mortgage protection meeting,h_p_bitchcraft,1,"No sales pitch, just going through options for life insurance.  I was only eligible for decreasing life insurance but we took out, critical illness cover for my husband, decreasing life insurance and income protection as he didn't earn a lot and his sick pay was government only. We have our annual meeting meeting next month to decide a new product given he now earns double what he did when we bought last year."

Environmental search showing possible problems,AutumnObsessed,1,"Our search results came back last night - HIGH RISK flood area. Baffled me - I know the area and as far as I know it has never flooded. I contacted the environment agency last night - they confirmed in an e mail this morning that there is no history of flooding. EVER at this property or road. I do wonder why it was therefore classed as a high risk. It has not put me off the purchase - however, it does not have a river in front of it like yours. So this may not be so helpful - but low to moderate risk would not put me off."
Environmental search showing possible problems,Ok-Horror-2211,3,"Just because somewhere hasn’t flooded doesn’t mean that there is no flood risk. It’s risk, not history. Saying that, it depends how the flood risk is calculated. Not all sections of watercourse have been modelled extensively due to the investment required (flood modelling is spendy). However for watercourses in England there is the National Flood Risk Assessment which has classified flood risk. If you’re near a watercourse you could do a flood map challenge which would mean a person would make an assessment.

If there are no records of flooding at the Environment Agency and you’re not near a watercourse your flood risk might be groundwater or surface water. In that instance you need to contact your Lead Local Flood Authority which is usually the County or Unitary Authority and ask them if they have any flood history for the area. Ask them if they have any S19 reports for the area and see what comes back. "

Glad that it’s not out you off the purchase, house hunting is a headache"
Environmental search showing possible problems,AutumnObsessed,1,Thank you so much - Yes that is what the environment agency said too. There is no histor of flooding but this does not mean it may never happen in future.

"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",MCObeseBeagle,4,"I've recently gone through this with an elderly neighbour in my block of flats who was obliged to claim off three different insurance claims for a series of leaks in his home, so I have a pretty good layman's understanding of this.

\- if the leak into your flat was caused by the building - i.e. the pipe serves multiple flats, and the building managers installed it, and it's not leaseholder-serviceable - start out with the building insurance, which will be done via your service charge by the freeholder (i.e. the council if I've read your post right)

\- if the leak into your flat was caused by the flat upstairs - i.e. they misinstalled the pipe which solely serves their flat - then you claim off that flat and their home insurance

\- if the leak into your flat was as a result of a leak from the flat ABOVE the flat upstairs, or as a result of a combination of points 1 and 2, use whoever was the starting point for the leak to decide which insurance to pursue. you may well end up with a chain of compensation

So that's a decent overview. However tihs worries me:

>We were also advised not to purchase our own home insurance by our solicitor because the block was covered.

Your solicitor should've advised you that you didn't need to buy BUILDING insurance as this would be done by the buildign owner (i.e. the freeholder) using your money from the service charge. however they should have advised you to buy your own HOME insurance to cover your contents and fire etc. Can you check this? If they've advised you what you've said above, you may have a claim against them!"
"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",spinach2point0,0,"So the tricky thing about our block is that it is mixed council owned and privately owned. We privately own and our flat is freehold, however the council are our factors and the entire block has an insurance policy supposedly managed by them. The flat above us is council owned and let. We have tried calling several times to speak to them however they are completely denying that this is the case. 

Yes our solicitor advised that we did not require buildings insurance and that the factors (the council) would be updated of the change of ownership and would be in touch with an invoice for factoring fees, my apologies for the lack of clarity! Haven't slept a wink."
"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",angel_k3m,3,"It's not tricky at all honestly! The ownerships of the individual leasehold flats isn't relevant here. In 99.9% of cases, the freeholder (the council in this case) is responsible for the building insurance. It is impossible for you to take out buildings on a single flat as it part of a larger structure and the buildings insurance needs to be on the whole structure.

The fact that the current insurance has expired is also not something to worry about as it would be the councils responsibility to renew it. It WILL be managed by them.

Assuming the leak has now stopped, you either need to contact the claims line on the expired insurance policy (it's highly likely the council will have renewed with the same people) or contact the council's homeowner/leaseholders department to get the details for the current insurer.

Don't be concerned that you haven't paid your share yet or had an invoice, the buildings policy will still be in force for the block."
"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",spinach2point0,0,"Been on and off phone with council all morning who are denying all when it comes to insurance, even though we have a document to say that they do! Argh.

Hope you're right and thanks for putting my mind at rest a little!

""Buy a house they said..."""
"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",MCObeseBeagle,2,"Are you CERTAIN the council is the freeholder? 

If so, look through your LPE1 form in your purchase collateral for their contact details. It may be that they think you're complaining as a resident rather than a leaseholder and the contact info may be separate. (Our freeholder has one set of contact details for day to day business and another for lease extensions.)

Leasehold is complex and it helps to start off talking to someone who understands their role as a freeholder. The standard issue council will have no idea."
"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",spinach2point0,0,"That's why I said it's tricky. We are a freehold flat, however the council are the factors of the block and still own 2 flats within the block. 

The factors take out block insurance in which we are included."
"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",MCObeseBeagle,2,"It really isn't tricky, you're just mixing up some terminology and that's not helping you. I'm not sure what you mean by 'factors' either. 

This may help: there is no such thing as a block of flats where some flats are freehold and others council. Flats are either: leasehold (with a third party freeholder) or leasehold with share of freehold (where every leaseholder is an equal member of the company which owns the freehold) .

I think from what you're telling me is that:

\- the block of flats has the council as a freeholder - the owner of the building

\- individual flats are made up of private leaseholders such as yourself, and council tenants (which may themselves have a leaseholder for a landlord, or, based on what you're saying, use the council themselves as their landlord. It doesn't really matter for the purposes of this conversation) - each is a 'leaseholder' as in they own a lease to live in the property for a certain amount of time based on a contract with the freeholder

If the leak is as a result of the building failure, you talk to the council as the freeholder as their responsibility to fix under the buildings insurance. If the leak is a result of an individual flat's failure, you talk to the council as the landlord of that flat's property. 

It's not tricky, you just need to recognise the way leasehold works, and the different hats an organisation can wear when engaging with the contracts. An organisation can be both the freeholder, the leaseholder, and the landlord of a tenancy, all in one. You just need to be clear about which capacity you're speaking to them in."
"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",spinach2point0,0,"Haha I'm afraid I have to prove you wrong. There is such a thing and we're literally living proof. Our flat is in a block of 4 and is freehold, another one is also freehold and the two above us are council. It's NOT a leasehold and it is tricky. I'm not mixing up my terminology, that's just the way it is! 

Factors is the terminology used by our solicitor to describe their role. We're in Scotland if that helps."
"If a pipe burst in upstairs flat damages my property, is it their (or their insurances) responsibility to fix the damage?",MCObeseBeagle,0,"If you'd been clearer that you were in Scotland from the start you might have saved us both a lot of time - instead of saying 'its tricky' you could've just given us the information we all needed before answering. Scotland doesn't have leasehold and freehold the way we do in the rest of the UK; it has commonhold and feuhold in what I imagine is a tenement like yours. The same concepts apply and you're still making the same mistakes, but you strike me as being someone who won't take yes for an answer and as such I think I've probably given as much help as I'm prepared to."

FTB- What now? [Advice wanted],McCretin,3,"If your solicitor, mortgage and survey are all arranged, there’s nothing you need to do at this stage.

Searches are one of the first things that solicitors do, in my experience, because they can take a while to come back.

Also, make sure that your home insurance includes building insurance and not just contents insurance.

You’ll need building insurance to complete the purchase, and given that you’re buying your first home, I’m assuming you’re moving from rented accommodation.

It’d be unusual if you already had buildings insurance because it’s almost always the landlord’s responsibility."

"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",Hydrangeamacrophylla,1,"It's such a ridiculous system - so much time, effort and expense with zero security until you have the keys in your hand. Usually the biggest financial decision you'll make in your life but the system is confusing and hard to navigate if it's your first time. 

It amazes me anyone successfully buys or sells anywhere and yet the whole system somehow chugs along."
"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",[deleted],1,Biggest joke - buying a house in the UK. Worse than childbirth. Also the fact that sellers and buyers can pull out at the last minute is ridiculous. Real estate is a big money making industry every one just leeching on the buyer and seller and Sucking them dry. Welcome!
"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",eternally-miw,1,The whole process of buying and selling made me depressed. Totally emphasize. It works out in the end!
"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",alexiahewson,5,Thank you for the empathy.
"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",alexiahewson,1,Exactly....
"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",DirectBookkeeper7242,1,"I think stamp duty is quite good, it stops people buying loads of properties although I do agree it should be higher for real estate investors"
"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",alexiahewson,-2,"I am not clueless and I am not slow, you don't know me at all so stop it. I know the solicitors quotes and I am fully aware of them, but they have added fees post quote. The fact that I am aware of the costs doesn't make the process easier."

"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",alexiahewson,0,Do you get some sort of high by trying to make internet strangers feel bad? Because you should probably have that checked.
"Buying a house is an absolute joke, a moan",[deleted],-9,"Couldn't care less how people feel. I do care about people learning from their mistakes, and slow sellers learning how to be quick sellers."

Buying a house with high subsidence risk rating,Illustrious_Dare_772,3,"You will need to wait until the survey comes back to see what that says, what level did you go for.

Environment reports are going to go by post code as on one could predict exactly could happen to a specific property in the event of an environmental issue due to all the variables.

If its high is the location near a former or current working mine or fast flowing water."
Buying a house with high subsidence risk rating,jacekowski,1,Where is the property?
Buying a house with high subsidence risk rating,wkwong90,2,On the report it says the property is located within 25 metres of an area that may be affected by Coal Mining.
Buying a house with high subsidence risk rating,wkwong90,1,"In Horsforth, Leeds, West Yorkshire."
Buying a house with high subsidence risk rating,Illustrious_Dare_772,1,There is your risk so its going to be down to what your survey says about the actual property and what the lender is willing to risk.
Buying a house with high subsidence risk rating,wkwong90,1,Okay I’ll just wait for the survey report thanks a lot! I don’t suppose it’s a deal breaker as we liked the property and the location is good too!
Buying a house with high subsidence risk rating,Illustrious_Dare_772,2,"Subsidence should be a deal breaker for you especially if the survey picks it up as present in the property, as your lender may want further information and evidence of preventative measures in place before agreeing to lend to you."
Buying a house with high subsidence risk rating,TheFirstMinister,2,"Not necessarily.  It depends. The Crooked House lasted for 200+ years until some bastard set it alight.

A house - like mine - which suffers from subsidence is perfectly stable because it's been underpinned.  There are scores of houses all across the Black Country, for example, which are stable AF because they've been braced and/or underpinned.

It all depends on the nature of any historical subsidence, what has been done (if anything) in terms of remedial work and what any future risk may be.  Some homes are simply too far gone and need to be demolished.  Some have no subsidence damage now but will in the future.  Again, it simply depends so the OP needs to wait for the report."

Wayleave agreement,Competitive_Gap_9768,6,"Completely normal.
The wayleave agreement is normally for the main supply in the road not the individual supplies tee’ing off it. 

The electrical under the house is likely to be your connection and terminate in your property."
Wayleave agreement,Little-Database,2,"I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker, but definitely worth checking over the terms of the wayleave in detail as typically they will include provisions to you from obstructing access ot the kit  which may have implications if you were for example to explore redevelopment at some point.

On a positive note the wayleave may  specify that there is an annual rent to be paid to the property owner. It probably won't be much but its always nice to get a cheeky £50 PA stipend curtesy of the utility company."
Wayleave agreement,ElectricalPick9813,1,"Was going to say something similar. I built a new house with two electric poles on the land. Every year, we would get a cheque ( remember them?) for about £10."
Wayleave agreement,Rare-Will131,1,"Thanks for your response. When i see the map, it goes all across the estate and doesn’t terminate at my property. I hope this is normal too? I really love this house and this is the only thing putting me off."
Wayleave agreement,Competitive_Gap_9768,2,"It’s pretty unusual to have a mains going underneath a property. 
Never known that before.

Wayleave agreement,anomalous_cowherd,2,"I lived on a small estate with 40 or so houses. Our house was apparently the last one built and all the services for the whole estate were run through our plot - electric, water, gas, everything. Then finally they built our house to finish the estate.

The gardens and patio were covered in manhole covers everywhere you looked."
Wayleave agreement,Rare-Will131,1,Strangely there is no legend on the map. There are dashed lines going across the estate which I assume are the electric cables.
Wayleave agreement,jeaby,3,"It'd be unusual for a big cable to run under the estate, the developers would likely have had to divert anything before building as utility providers really dont like not having access to their burried asset.  
Depending on how bored you are and how much you want to find out you could go to a website called linesearchbeforeyoudig.  You can plot the area on the map, fill in some details and it automatically searches the utility providers plans for the plans relevant to your query.  Not everyone signs up to it but the big elec, gas and water suppliers do."
Wayleave agreement,Competitive_Gap_9768,2,"The wayleave will be accurate though. 

I think some terms eg estate are getting lost in translation here. OP can you upload part or all the drawing please?"

Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,dotmit,2,If you’re in a block of flats the block buildings insurance should cover your damage
Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,Unlikely_Concept5107,2,"Quite a bit of crap advice in this thread so far.

First of all there is no legal requirement to purchase home insurance of any kind, regardless of whether you rent, have a mortgage or own outright.  If mortgaged, you’d likely be in breach of their T&C’s but still not a legal requirement unlike third party motor insurance for example.

Secondly, for your neighbour to be held liable for damage, you have to be able to prove negligence so, for example, you can demonstrate that you made them aware that water was entering your flat and they took no action which led to damage and you being out of pocket.

You’ll need to make a claim via your own insurance. If they think they have a case to try to reclaim that money from your neighbour (as per paragraph above) they can chose do so and you’d get your excess back.

But I’d say it’s very, very unlikely unfortunately."
Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,Sneadleboo,1,"Not in a block. It’s a downstairs flat and an upstairs. Imagine a semi detached split in two horizontally. 
The upstairs don’t have insurance as they own the flat outright."
Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,Sneadleboo,1,That’s really helpful thanks.
Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,dotmit,9,"They should still have insurance even if it’s a share of freehold. So should you (or your landlord).

They are liable for covering your damage if they haven’t got insurance. Check in r/LegalAdviceUK"
Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,Sneadleboo,1,"Thinks legal advice is still dark? 
As far as my knowledge is they don’t require insurance legally (as they own it outright). 

Our insurance is a £700 excess which we have to pay."
Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,dotmit,3,If they have a mortgage I’m pretty sure they need insurance to go with it! They are still liable for repairing your damage whether they have insurance or not
Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,Sneadleboo,2,Not quite clear in my first comment but they don’t have a mortgage as they own it outright.
Upstairs neighbour’s boiler leaked,dotmit,3,"Aah I wasn’t sure. They are fools for not having insurance. They are still liable for repairing your home!

FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,itallstartedwithapub,9,"If your colleague's surveyor missed a dangerous structural fault that would have been detectable by the survey and within the scope of the survey, the surveyor would be liable for damages and your colleagues could sue them for their losses. Did they mention what this issue was exactly?

Regardless, you should get a survey. It's a relatively small cost which in most cases won't reveal any showstoppers, but if it does it could save you from a nightmare purchase."
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,PoopyPogy,6,"Yeeeeah, surveys are full of disclaimers.. it was raining, it was dark, we didn't move anything, we didn't go into the roof,  we haven't tested the gas or electrics so are just going to assume it's all deathly dangerous etc etc...

But the problem is, if you don't get one, then you're guaranteed to be totally in the dark and have no idea and no recourse against anyone at all. 

Purchasing property is ""buyer beware"" - it's entirely up to you to satisfy yourself about the physical condition of the property. If you're good at DIY and know what you're looking at, or have cash to throw away on fixing stuff you thought was OK, or if you have someone who's super knowledgeable and you really trust who you can take around and can help advise then great, maybe that's okay for you. But it's up to you to make that decision. Having a survey just arms you with more information to help decide whether you're happy to accept the risks of home ownership for that particular house, and at what price. 

Also if you have a survey done and it doesn't throw up any issues - great that's a good thing! 

I had an estate agent tell a buyer recently that they didn't need to have a survey because the NHBC warranty was still in place. But, they're not the same thing. That's like saying yeah, the car you're buying is going to be insured if you crash, so you don't need to check the tyres before paying for it. Who wants to move into a new home and then have to deal with structural issues and an insurance claim and builders etc?"
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Xenoamor,4,"I think your colleague might have just had a bad surveyor. My report was excellent, had tons of details and it also broke down what areas would need maintenance, when and how to do it

It was a level 3 though and I went for one of the best in the area"
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Happy_Assumption7983,3,Some new builds have the most amount of issues. There are no down sides to having a survey when spending that much money.
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,FirstTimeBuyersUK,2,"I will always recommend getting a home survey, even on a brand new home because mistakes do happen and building control can miss issues. 

Home surveys are often very misunderstood by the people who instruct them. Qualified surveyors follow a standardised checklist of items to inspect and then write a report on what they observe. They will highlight areas they see as issues but they also make you aware of common issues they see in other properties. Most will take you on a walk-through of their report to answer any of your questions.

You're spending thousands of pounds on a home. It's therefore in your best interest to be armed with as much knowledge as you can get of what you are buying and what common issue you should look out for in the future. 

Have a look on the RICS website for detailed information about the different levels of survey. I think you are correct for considering a level 2 survey. This website shows you the standard which the surveyors have to adhere to. 

https://www.rics.org/profession-standards/rics-standards-and-guidance/sector-standards/building-surveying-standards/home-surveys"
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Careless-Ad2579,2,"Building surveyor here. Just wanted to add that it’s incorrect to say homebuyers reports have no legal standing - surveyors who fail to identify issues that they should have picked up on are covered by Personal Indemnity insurance which the surveyor will refer any claim for negligence to - often successfully.

Your colleague may be slightly misrepresenting what actually happened to them/their property and it may not be reasonable to hold the surveyor to account for not foreseeing the unforeseeable. 

I would also caution you against paying bottom dollar for a survey - generally you do get what you pay for, although a level 2 survey for a newish build is probably sufficient if carried out by a fully Chartered Surveyor."
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Popocorno95,2,"I was of the idea that a servere fault that was missed could be claimed against, but he (for whatever reason) was pretty convinced it wasn't a claim he could/would win. I suspect there's more at play but didn't bother enquiring further. He didn't tell me what the fault was, and it didn't sound like he really necessarily knew what the problem was, just that he had to fork out a builder to repair it. 

Thanks for the advice. For the sake of £340 I think I'm still going to book one in."

FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Popocorno95,1,Very good point!
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,CozyMod,1,The best advice. Rather get a lower level and use the difference to get a drain/elec survey. New builds are notoriously shit.

FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Popocorno95,1,We will be getting an electric safety check certificate as part of the home purchasing process - would you still recommend a seperate electric survey? Also are newer homes known to have drain issues? I haven't considered a drain survey and honestly this is the first recommendation I've seen for one!
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,FirstTimeBuyersUK,1,You are welcome. I have my own sub where I can answer more of your questions on being a first time buyer.
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,CozyMod,1,"I wouldn't get an elec survey because sparkies are intelligent. I can't say the same about the grunts who install the drains. They oftentimes ignore building regs, nhbc and sewers for adoptions codes and just install the pipes like legos. I worked on construction sites for 5years and now have my own drainage company, and I do a lot of surveys for people like you, which is why I said so. The drains are also hidden under the house so you never know if something's wrong until shit hits the fan. Most scenarios they forget things in there, install the drains so wrong that hydraulic/gravity fall simply isnt there and you have to unblock your drains every couple months, costing you a fortune in the long run. I could go on all day. I saw a photo on linked in of some site manger being very proud of his groundworkers, the install was complete rubbish, absolutely disgusting, and no one in the comments even realised. I'm goign to look for it, so you can see why i'm terrified of new builds."
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Popocorno95,1,Thanks! Just joined!
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Popocorno95,1,"Out of curiosity - would you expect these problems start showing themselves at some point in 8 years, or would it generally take longer to start showing these problems? Obviously as the house is not brand new any problems with the drains will not be covered by any warranty, so I guess any problems wouldn't be worth continuing with the purchase?"
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,CozyMod,1,"I would say if the drains havent blocked at all in 8 years, they're probably ok. They are designed to be self-cleansing, so when they block, you have an issue. These issues can be structural (collapse, break, snagging points, roots, caused by external factors such as works taking place nearby) and can be wrong design/installation leading to poor performance. Ask the previous owner if he had any issues with the drains.The most important pthing for you would be to find out where all the rain water goes. It can go to the sewers or into the ground. You don't want it going into the ground because you'll get damp and subsidence if the soil is clay. The cost of addressing drains installed as discharging into clay soil is often the cost of underpinning the house and then re-routing the drains away so you'd be looking at 20k +, which insurance won't cover as you've just moved in, so its pre-existing.

I've tried explaining this a couple of this before on this sub, but i always get downvoted into oblivion as redditors don't like to hear about drains. The cost of the drain survey should be about 250-450 depending on where you are and number of bathrooms so get it, its worth, but ask to know about the surface water, it's crucial. If you're buying a flat in a block outside london, don't bother getting a drain survey."
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Popocorno95,1,Ill ask that question now - thank you! I can see on my water/drainage search pack that surface water from the property drains to the public sewer - I assume that is what I would want it to do in regards to your comment up above?

FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,CozyMod,1,">I had a case where the property was shown as discharging to the sewer, but the previous owner had gotten planning for an extension. His planning was conditioned by introducing a rainfall runoff betterment, as he was now collecting more rainwater with his new roof. He would have surcharged the sewer in the road. His solution was to install a soakaway, and disconnect himself from the main sewer. He did, and installed the sokaway in clay. 5 years later he has subsidence and the buyer is now underpinning the house. I discovered it during the survey, did trial pits, surveyed all the pipework, did borehole down to 5m, and in the end, presented with all the factual information, the structural engineer said underpinning is a must. Cost was well over 20k which got knocked off the price of the house."
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,Popocorno95,1,Thanks for the detailed explanation - the property has not been modified in any way since it was built in 2014. No extensions or changes to the buildings structure have occured. I imagine the likelihood that the information from the searches in this event should be factually correct? Or is there a chance other changes to the property beyond significant extensions could have resulted in this info being incorrect?
FTB (UK) Homesurvey or Not?,CozyMod,1,"Shroedinger's drains. Both connected to sewer and not, until you look."

There's an even higher chance that someone visiting OP will have an EV or PHEV. Any hire car or courtesy car is progressively more likely to be a PHEV or EV

Even if they don't use the charger before it breaks, they will almost inevitably EVENTUALLY get an EV (petrol cars will be banned), therefore even just having the 32A cable and circuit breaker already installed has *some* value

And even if somehow they really don't have any use for an EV charger in the entire time they own the house, OP can stick a £10 adapter in it and it becomes a 3-pin plug they can use for a lawnmower/pressure washer/christmas lights/barbecue/patio heater etc

I'm missing something here, however.

The seller planted trees on (what was then) her property. The trees then negatively affected the neighbor's property but not her/your house? Am I being dim by saying that if there's no damage to what is now your house I don't see the issue? Surely the owner has a right to plant trees on their property and if, down the road, thirsty roots affect the neighbor's soil then file it under ""oh well""?

Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"Thank you for the laugh! Even as a buyer I know how insanely stupid it is to hide problems. Not even as a ""I dont want to be screwed over"" but if I ever wanted to sell a property with subsidence, especially if it hasnt had remedial work, I know how much crap Id be in... Of course there's a difference between claiming ignorance/genuinely not knowing than purposely hiding it. Either way, I'm not sure, but I assume that's up to my solicitors and other legal representatives to find out and determine.

My biggest worry is that the seller refused outright to admit any fault or pay any money towards the reconstruction of the neighbours conservatory. So if I could prove that she knew there was subsidence and chose not to disclose, that doesn't mean she'll pay up. But that's a different problem for later on down the line if it gets to there.

I assume my home insurance won't pay out because this is ""presxisting"" subsidence and should've been declared, but of course I didn't because I didn't know."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"Definitely not disclosed on the TA6. As well, when asked about the trees she explicitly stated in an email that the trees belonged to the neighbouring properties which definitely is not the case."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"There is potential evidence of subsidence. Especially on the drive as a portion of it at the bottom has semi-collpased/you can see a hole. In the front porch/hallway there is cracking above the door and ceiling. Most cracks present around the house are hairline cracks, whereas these front hallway are bordering on 3mm which is allegedly the tell tale sign that you may need a surveyor. 

Of course, I won't know for certain if it is subsidence until I get a surveyor out. But I fully believe the neighbours claims to be genuine because she definitely planted the trees and then claimed she didn't.

Sorry its hard to describe! The cracks are also 'pulling apart' and not just like a crack that stays the same width and follows the same line. I do have pictures I am willing to share, but I'm not sure they necessarily matter because a surveyor should be able to validate these concerns :)

EDIT: spelling, also thank you for the sub recomendation. Might prove useful if I end up needing to remove the tree. (Totally unrelated, but there's an ancient tree that's well over 100 years old, that is half on my property/garden and half not, so I'll probably need to get myself acquainted with tree law - this tree is not at all a problem. It's well away from any structures)"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Difficult-Parfait347,2,"The roots extract moisture from the ground, causing movement. I’ve seen this come up before when buying a house where the owner had planted a magnolia tree in the front garden. The recommendation was to remove the tree and the movement would stabilise again. The foundations were clay (south London) and is apparently quite common"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,2,"Tree roots can grow under the foundations and some trees are super water thirsty and suck up loads of the ground water causing the soil/ground to shrink especially if its over soft clay deposits. You cant simply remove the trees either because then the ground may bulge because theres one less tree soaking up all that ground water. 

So basically, the house was built, and then she planted trees that have grown and now altered the ground. If she didn't plant the trees, then there likely wouldn't have been any subsidence, assuming there's nothing like coal mining or other environmental issues.

I did know there were trees on the property, some that are along the boundary lines and I wanted to double check if they would be my responsibility or the neighbours. As you can see, trees can cause loads of problems, especially if you plant them too close to a building which she seems to have done. Preexisting mature/established trees or responsibly planted trees won't cause an issue because they're either already established or you've put safe guarding measures in place.

No stupid questions here! I didnt know about any of this until I start house hunting :)

EDIT: Replied to someone below about the characteristics of the tree, and suspicions on when it was planted and how it potentially caused the neighbours subsidence. 

So far, I am currently inclined to believe the neighbours over giving the previous owner benefit of the doubt. There's been a host of concerns raised about the previous owner, of course all are independent of each other and the validity of one doesn't prove the validity of another. But I digress!"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,[deleted],2,"I have to agree there.  Big old trees (several decades old) in very close proximity to a house can cause subsidence, but if these are relatively recently planted, it's fairly unlikely they truly have any impact on the neighbour's conservatory."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,0,"Madness. I get people do dumb stuff all the time thinking theyre far more intellectual than they really are, but for someone to think they actually could bullshit enough to get away with something like Japanese Knotweed is insane. Like subsidence is bad for you and those around you (depending on the cause) but knotweed can really wreak havock and devastate a lot of flora and fauna."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Bluffjay,1,I planted some biggish trees at my old property… right near the house however I put them in large pots and overtime they become “pot bound” and they didn’t really grow tall… when I sold the house I told the buyer he can either remove them or keep an eye on them as they can grow quite big if they manage to escape out the pots
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,SparkyLou999,1,"If she has lied once, then perhaps has lied elsewhere. If it goes to court then she will have to pay up, do you have legal cover with your insurance?"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,TheFirstMinister,0,"And these issues are affecting your (new) house?

It sounds like subsidence based on your descriptions. 

But.

Confirming the definitive root cause(s) so as to have a judge issue a ruling against the seller may be tricky. It may also cost more than any repair works. 

Subsidence is typically a slow moving affair and can be caused by multiple factors some of which occur at different times. Soil expands and contracts naturally. Water, if not correctly routed, can do a wealth of damage well beneath our feet. A poorly built addition may start to sink because it was, well, poorly built.

Subsidiary isn't unsolvable, however. A house that is underpinned with a proper water drainage system in place will be just fine. My own house is underpinned all the way around and has been lifted by 1/4 inch. The soil turns to wet clay when it rains and talcum powder when dry. The house continues to move - all houses move - but within acceptable tolerances. It's not going anywhere though bar an earthquake. When I sell it the underpinning will actually be an ""attractive feature"" which won't add any financial value, but won't detract either."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,GasLit_munkey,1,"Fair enough. 
I think this is similar to heave in as much as roots and the actual plant creating movement in the ground. So strictly speaking , probably not subsidence in as much as it is movement. But a problem nonetheless.

Mind you, the planted trees would have to be hecka close to the adjacent structure to cause movement on the foundations then?"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,GasLit_munkey,1,Crikey. It sounds like there should have been some sort of restrictive covenant governing the planting of trees on the property! I get how they can damage nearby property though. It’s the problem with these new estates. Built for high density living with minimal environmental scope. They will have us living in stacked boxes in giant warehouses soon. And paying for the luxury. 😂😂😂
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"They weren't planted recently. Not sure when, or how large the saplings were when they were planted, but the tree the neighbours have a problem with is right next to the boundary and is an Oak tree that is taller than the house. It's definitely a ""younger tree"" based on my amateur observations alone. Ofc a surveyor and a tree surgeon will provide the actual answers but it is alleged that she planted it alongside a few other trees and this has been reported by different people.

EDIT: Younger tree, as in its trunk isn't very wide and its branches are quite spindly, which for Oak makes it younger? No clue, but apparently it wasn't there originally. Don't know when the neighbours bought their property, but it would seem that they built their conservatory, then the tree was planted, and the roots have disrupted the ground and caused it to subside. They have since had it redone. Not sure if that included underpinning or anything. Not sure if they had a surveyor determine the cause and identify that tree in particular. I have yet to speak to them and see if they'd be willing to answer some questions on the matter."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"Yes, these issues are in my house/the house I bought and now live in. 

Thank you for your response, and yeah theres a chance she just wont pay up after everything is said and done, no matter how ""in the right"" I am or what a judge would rule. She refused to admit any fault or offer any compensation to the neighbour. (I hope speaking with them could shine a lot more light on this dispute). So all those legal fees just to end up back at square one with a couple thousand less to my name.

I'd be more worried about subsidence if I was in the process of buying the property and then it was discovered and of course hadn't been rectified because securing a mortgage with the high street lenders could be difficult and as FTB that's a lot of added stress. So in a way its a blessing that its been discovered/brought to my attention since I've moved in and everything is set in stone. At the end of the day, if it needs remedial work or underpinning (or whatever is the best course in my case) then that's what it takes. There's a lot of cracks here and there because as you mentioned, it's a house, it's going to move about as it settles, especially since its a newer build. But of course I don't want it to get worse, even if it takes many years from now to properly come to fruition.

I'm also not worried about the resell of the property, as I have a 5 year fixed and right now I have zero reason to want to move in the foreseeable future so its something I envision that I will have rectified before selling years from now. And as you say, as long as its been rectified, it's a non-issue. Of course, in an ideal world I'd like there to be a simple solution, but I have to pay out of pocket because the seller refuses to cooperate or my insurance won't pay out because its preexisting subsidence then oh well. Its my home, and as long as it isn't immediately collapsing (which it isn't at risk of doing), it can wait until I have the means to fund it. In the future I'd like to have an extension built, so perhaps it's something that can be conducted as a part of the same project?

I've waffled on for a bit, but again thank you. Reassuring to know that it's just sometimes the way the cookie crumbles :)"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"Tell me about it. The seller appears to have been a bit of a loose cannon with many questionable choices. It would appear she tried to make the garden a little wildlife eco zone with a toad pond, hedgehog house, and other log piles for insects, all of which has caused issues with the neighbours because of fleas, rats, and seagulls often stealing the food left out for the aforementioned wildlife. The property includes a bit of land to the side that does have a restrictive covenant that it can only be used as a garden. No garage, no permanent sheds, no trailers etc. But of course that didnt include altering the ground composition with large trees. There's a large sewer network under it, hence why there's a restrictive covenant, but that didn't stop large trees being nearby. Not sure what came first, the trees or the sewers, but I imagine that's a fun thing for a surveyor or the water company to find out for me... lol"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,GasLit_munkey,1,"When you say right next to the boundary, how far is it from their conservatory? And which came first do you know?"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,treemonkey58,1,"What species are the offending trees? Oak trees are quite a slow-growing species and I'd be quite surprised if it's caused ALOT of damage, not saying it wouldn't cause any. 
How close to the building are they? 
Sorry if there's nothing useful there, I'm a tree surgeon so trying to gauge how big they are etc."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,[deleted],1,But the property is only 17 years old.  These trees won't be causing subsidence as long as you're alive.
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"I added an edit to my comment above, but I believe their conservatory came first. Which now that I think about it, it does seem a little unreasonable to assume in 17 years a conservatory was built, then a tree was planted that then caused the conservatory to subside.

The tree is right next to the boundary fence. As far as I'm aware the fence is theirs and it does sit right on the boundary between my property and theirs. I'm not a great judge of distance, but their conservatory takes up half of the length of their garden, which I know doesn't really tell you anything about how close the tree actually actually is, but Oaks are apparently super water thirsty trees, so maybe it's not the roots growing under their conservatory, but just the amount of ground water it's removed from the immediate area?

I really hope talking to the neighbour in question can really clear things up."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,0,"It's an Oak and the other is a Pine. The Oak is taller than the house (semi detached two story) and the pine wouldn't fit in the average UK living room if used as a Christmas tree, as its a good meter higher. Not sure which species exactly. The Oak is the main offender in regards to the neighbours conservatory. I tried measuring it with my 8m tape measurer and I was roughly a meter to two meters short, so I'd say the tree is around the 9m mark from my house and maybe the same from the conservatory. I do have pictures I am willing to share."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"Not even when factoring in them sucking up a lot of the ground water? I think that's the primary issue, not necessarily the roots going under the foundation. I'm no expert though of course, just going off knowledge I've picked up online. I'm sure a surveyor will be able to give me a much clearer picture, of course right now this is all just speculation and wanting to figure out if there's any recourse via a misrepresentation claim or insurance if it is subsidence. :)"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,GasLit_munkey,1,"So the conservatory came first, then the tree? The tree(s) are somewhere between 10-17 yrs old? The ones causing the problem? Less than 10 hrs old for an oak and I wouldn’t expect a proximity problem. 

How have the subsidence issues manifested? Have you seen these? Can it be certain that the subsidence is caused by the tree or is it general settling from made-up ground? I.e. is the neighbour’s property also 17 yrs old? How does the neighbour know whether the conservatory was installed correctly to prevailing building regs? Was it signed off by BC (unsure whether this was a requirement 17yrs ago). Also, did the conservatory have planning? (This has implications on it’s extent of construction). Has the private drive suffered subsidence related to the trees too? What are the defects witnessed? I think there a A LOT more questions to be asked than just assuming that what the incumbent neighbour is saying about the party that left is true and unbiased to their own interests. You may find the trees are blocking light and this offends them and the purpose of their conservatory in which case the perfect reasoning for having you remove the trees AT YOUR COST is to blame it on them and not general settlement of made up ground/poor installation of footings. Does the conservatory have a dwarf wall and footings for example? Lot of questions. Also, proximity to be of importance would have to be <10m?"
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Limp-Archer-7872,1,"These do not sound big enough to be causing issues, unless the building is only a couple of metres away.

Got an overhead diagram?

What is the girth of the oak? You can then use a tree age calculator online."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,[deleted],2,"Yes, this can be an issue, but not with such young trees."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,GasLit_munkey,1,"Crikey, I think you maaaaaayyy be focusing too much on the water absorption aspect. If these were Blue Gum trees, then maybe as some trees can consume hundreds of litres of water a day - so i have been told - but you need to check before that assumption. Also, the height of the Oak and the age of the tree don’t add up. To my understanding, Oaks are extremely slow to grow… so something two stories high would suggest a LOT older and May predate structures that have been constructed too close?

Also, sounds like it’s possibly greater than 10m from both structures. That’s quite key because it mitigates her alleged negligence.

Subsidence would be a major ongoing resale concern now and in 5, 10, 20 years time so…. Don’t lose the initiative on this i’d suggest."
Seller Caused Subsidence and Didn't Declare it,Roisty09,1,"You make some great points. There's a lot of unknowns as I only learnt about everything yesterday and I haven't been able to catch the neighbours in question for a chat. But there is evidence of subsidence in my property that I spotted earlier after I moved in, but I wasn't concerned about because it's not going to collapse overnight and I believed all the trees have always been present, or at least were present before the house was built so there's less concern about the ground drastically changing due to a new tree entering the playing field, or so to speak.

But of course with this new wealth of patchy information, the cracks and evidence I spotted prior went from ""maybe it's just because the house has settled"" to ""yeah, the seller might have actually caused a bit of headache and lied about it"", emphasis on the lied about it part.

Evidence being a hole in the private road which my drive attaches to. Hard to explain, but its a private road that stems from the road in the cul-de-sac, and I'm at the bottom, being the fourth house on this stretch. It's pretty evident its a cavity, so I can't park there just incase it collapses to reveal a small 1ft hole of some kind. As well as cracks in the hallway/porch (close to the drive and those tree that has potentially caused the susbsidence) rather are ""pulling away"" from themselves. It's not a concise line that stays the same shape, it's a few cracks nearing the 3mm mark that definitely look more ""separated"" than just a crack."

To buy or not to buy - Long read sorry!,Thomas__O,3,"Hi, I'm a structural engineer by profession, so I can give some advice in that sense.

Do you know when / how long ago the works were complete? Generally subsidence is a long term issue with cracking occurring over years. If the works were carried out a few years ago, and no new cracks are present it would be fair to assume the drainage issue and subsidence is gone. 

It might be possible to get drawings of the remedial works and view what has been done. A professional could have a better understanding of the whole picture.

Subsidence is common, especially in new builds, it is a monitor and see case.

For that reason I personally avoided new builds and would avoid a house with KNOWN subsidence issues. The house your looking at could well be fine though"
To buy or not to buy - Long read sorry!,[deleted],1,">The surveyor who did the home report has basically said if I'm happy with the findings then he is but I'm not.

Why is a professional in the industry (granted he's not a structural engineer, but he's probably far more experienced than you) saying he is satisfied if you are? He is the professional in this case, he should be satisfying your concerns (or advising you to steer clear, as much as he could within his role).

>My solicitor is pushing for the house to have its value readjusted on the basis of this finding.

If I were to proceed in a similar situation, this is exactly what I'd be doing.

>If I was to push for a structural survey from a structural surveyor rather than a valuation one who would pay for it? Me or the seller?

You, although you could add the cost of the survey to the negotiation above. If you decided not to proceed, you'd not be able to claim this money back.

Personally I'd avoid the house, it may be fine, it may not be. Subsidence just isn't worth the risk and pain to sort it out. There should be enough alternatives if you're patient."

Question about bills,TheAviatorPenguin,7,"It's too late on NYE to be price checking, but it looks like you've got the biggies.

The one thing I'd consider as a ""bill"" that I don't see is money put aside for an emergency fund, I'm assuming as you're FTB you won't have a huge wadge of contingency funds available, so putting some away each month to build up a buffer for unexpected stuff (such as the boiler irretrievably packing in) would be wise. 

What you put away is up to you, I'd propose about £100 a month if you can, but if you don't treat it like a bill it just won't happen."

Similarly, check the cancellation terms on your movers, and consider how much you're willing to risk losing due to delayed completion Vs how much you want to secure the moving date. They might offer a cancellation fee waiver for a little extra to offset the risk (but still cheaper than a 30-50% cancellation fee!)

Booking tradespeople is fine, since they're easier to cancel/postpone.

What is going on? Source of funds > completion,ex0-,2,"> Should they have removed our deposit from our LISAS if our deposit hasn’t passed their ‘compliance’ checks?

AML checks are an ongoing thing and aren't always completed at the start of a transaction. The sols may have decided it was necessary to obtain further statements prior to exchange to show the funds moving to your account or to show that the giftor didn't receive any unusual transfers between the first set of statements in July and the new set in Oct. In 2023 it's very easy to obtain and send statements, asking for a timeframe to produce them is a bit weird though your situation does explain it a bit better. I'd expect to have just received an email with the PDF statements attached rather than queries and requests for timeframes.

> And we have put buildings insurance on the house we are buying, at their request.

Because your lender requires you to insure the property from the date of exchange. They are just having you do this in advance to cover all bases."

Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,Loud_Low_9846,5,"You're not legally obliged to get an EICR for a property you live in, only if you let it out which would explain why the current owners haven't got one. That said it would obviously be better to get the electrics sorted out when you move in."
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,[deleted],6,"I'm in a similar situation. Single woman, work from home, and have a dog.  I found out my house needed a complete rewire after completion a couple of weeks ago. I was mortified. It was a death trap! There had been a young family in this house too. People don't check their electrics through ignorance, or because they can't afford to repair. Don't worry about the EICR for the insurance, it's irrelevant, it's only important so you and your quoting electricans can see the scale of the work needed and for your safety.  Nobody asked about it when I got my buildings insurance. 

I thought I couldn't do it either, financially or emotionally. But you can and I can. 5k sounds very reasonable for a rewire, especially if the vendors are chipping in. My quote was £500 for making good- the electricians have a plasterer they work with who they spoke to. You will at least then have complete walls and you can decorate a bit at a time when you feel able to. You don't need a complete replaster of whole walls- the channels can be filled and the plaster feathered. You won't be in a building site, it just won't be quite how you imagined for a while. 

The covers on the sockets are neither here nor there. They just screw on and don't tell you what's underneath. No reason you can't keep them and reuse if you wish. The electricians can talk you through what's required in each room. My kitchen has tiled walls and floors too,- they will come up under the floor at the back of the kitchen cabinets. Some tiles will need to be replaced, but it doesn't all come out. Apparently my kitchen tiles are still available, but at worst you can get a few in a contrasting colour and make a feature of it! 

Ask the electricians anything you need to. They want to reassure you and make things as easy as possible, and they're used to explaining everything. If they aren't helpful and patient about that, then get a different contractor."
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,TheFatHeffer,3,"Electrician here.

Two different electricians saying you probably need a rewire, then you probably need a rewire.

If they're good, they can do their best to minimise dust and mess, but there will always be some. My advice would be get it done asap upon moving in. Try and keep your stuff in the middle of the rooms (or in one corner where no sockets are going to be) with dust sheets over the top. If they're working with the plasterer, then they could 1st and 2nd fix in one week potentially. Then it will be livable and just need decorative work. And you'll have peace of mind. You can also choose where you'd like sockets and lights etc.

Living somewhere else for the week would be preferable, but it is possible to live there while they work."
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,Sistem21,1,"Only your lender and insurer can tell you if you need house rewire. Changing those two might be cheaper.

Unless you see or hear sparks, it might not be as bad as tradesmen say. Search at amazon for sockets tester, the one that shows if Earth is working as it should.
If in doubt, also buy protective RCD 30mA plugs.

Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,roxieh,-2,"Okay, but what if the house catches fire because of outdated electrics, and my insurance won't cover me because I clearly have evidence or knowledge of the electrics being faulty / unsafe?

Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,roxieh,3,"Thank you so much, this has so reassured me. The contractor I'm working with has been recommended by word of mouth and he seems lovely. Electrician likewise, I've used one of them before and keen to work with them again. Patient and friendly but doesn't talk down to you like you're an idiot, you know?


I looked at a few YouTube videos on rewiring and it doesn't look as bad as I was imagining. I am assuming the carpets can be put down again after being pulled up for the floorboards. I am happy the vendors are willing to contribute, although I know their budget is a bit tight too. 


I have to remember I don't have to do everything all at once (although probably sooner the better on electrics and plastering). 


5k was a ballpark, I am waiting for the full quote hopefully tomorrow before I go back to regenotiate sale price / cash on completion from the vendor. Fingers crossed. Also nice point about the contrasting tiles in the kitchen, ha! 


I just want to be sure I take care of myself financially and don't take on something I can't afford. My current budget puts me at saving around £500 a month so hopefully even with everything I'll still be okay. "
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,roxieh,1,"Thank you. Yes I would prepare to get the work done if I went ahead with the purchase, I don't really like all the ""Well I'm sure it'll be fine"" attitude here because, I mean, it's my safety at the end of the day. I just want to know if it would take months but it sounds relatively simple in theory.


My main worries are the kitchen and bathroom, both fully tiled floors and walls. Can rewiring be done so as not to damage the tiles? Most of the rooms I was going to redecorate eventually because there's hideous wallpaper on them but the kitchen and bathroom I won't have the money for that for a while. "
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,roxieh,-1,"Lender did a survey and valuation and gave me a mortgage offer, does that mean they don't care? 


I haven't approached insurers yet because not even close to exchange. Wouldn't I have to disclose the electrics status and provide EICR? "
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,Loud_Low_9846,1,That's a risk with any property and no you probably wouldn't be covered for something you already know is an issue. Therefore it makes sense that you get the electrical rewiring done as soon as you purchase. I had the same with my previous house. There was never an EICR on that when I bought it. I had work done to the electrics and it was found that the supply was coming from outside the property so didn't switch off at the fuse box. I got a trusted electrician in and all the wiring was replaced and separate ring mains installed to separate different areas plus a surge protector for all our PCs. It's straightforward enough for a skilled electrician.
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,TheFatHeffer,1,"I'm afraid at least some of the tiles would have to come off. But there may be workarounds.

Bathrooms usually just have electrics in the ceiling, i.e. lights and extractor fan. These can be wired from the loft only which means no damage to tiles. The only things that may come down the walls are shaver points, electric towel rails, electric shower, etc. if you have these at all. Depending on the layout of your house, some of these cables could be chased down from the other side of the wall assuming it's an internal wall.

As for the kitchen, that's more difficult. Without tiles coming off you could either:

* Leave the existing electrics in the kitchen and rewire it separately at a later date. Perhaps if you are thinking of a new kitchen at some point.
* Run the cables in the most convenient routes to avoid the tiles and maybe use trunking on top of tiles where necessary. Looks a bit ugly though.
* Bite the bullet and rip off only the tiles that are in the way of cabling.

These things depend on the layout of your kitchen. Difficult to know without seeing it. But those would be my thoughts."
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,Loud_Low_9846,1,No they don't care and yes you may have to disclose to Insurers. One of the normal questions they ask is whether the property is maintained in good condition. It may be worth telephoning for a quote and then they can tell you whether there are any exclusions they may apply to the policy until the electrical and damp work is completed.
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,roxieh,1,"Was it really disruptive or messy to make good again, or is it quite easily livable after the work is gone? I would do the works if I went ahead with the purchase I just want to know what I'm letting myself in for really (eg months of hassle or a couple of weeks). "
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,roxieh,2,"Thank you, very helpful.


The bathroom is ground floor and added later, somewhat adjacent to the kitchen, and has a flat roof so no loft access. Kitchen likewise as this was added as n extension probably when the electrics were last checked. So sounds like there may be tile damage :( I will discuss with electricians what to do and when I suppose. I would not really plan for a new kitchen in the house. "
Please help me manage expectations about a potential house rewire. ,Loud_Low_9846,1,"It was liveable, wasn't that messy as just pulling wiring through using what was already there as a guide. A lot of work was actually done in the loft putting all the ring  mains in. Also added lots of sockets in my current house which took a couple of days. It meant floorboards coming up for a while but not the whole floor by any means and I found it still liveable."

"Water supply pipe leak, insurance won't cover",intrigue_investor,3,"**I checked with Conveyancing solicitor who basically said the cost of pursuing the previous owner would outweigh the cost of repair.**

**Would it be possible to somehow claim off previous owner's insurance?**

No

Are you on a metered bill?  Because if you leave this long enough it will end up costing a fair amount given usage of 1 litre per 7 seconds

All things considered options are (in my opinion):

* Hope the insurance pays out
* If not then fix it (both due to cost / potential damage)
* And complain against the insurer and see where you get"

Property purchase - subsidence issue,Anaksanamune,2,"If there was a certificate issues then it should not unreasonably effect anything, that's the whole point of them, to stop people being stuck with a property forever that they can't insure or sell.

Yes you will have to tell the insurance company about it, but with the certificate it should not unreasonably increase premiums.

Mortgage valuations only skim the very surface, it's not surprising they didn't pick it up, on some properties it's not much more involved than checking the house is still physically standing... This is a slight exaggeration, but closer to the truth than some people realise.

A level 3 survey is unlikely to add anything of massive value for this specific issue. This issue would have been picked up on the level 2 anyway, see points 2 - 5 on this table: https://www.samconveyancing.co.uk/news/house-survey/difference-between-level-2-and-level-3-survey

A level 2 would be pretty useless if they didn't spot something major like subsidence...

If there was visible cracking then at that stage it would be worth considering a structural engineer, but I don't see what they would be able to advise on if there is no problem.

An indemnity policy is unlikely to benefit you, what do you think you are indemnifying against when you already have an official certificate of adequacy...?"

Insuring a house with missing building regulation certs,itallstartedwithapub,5,"The real test is - will they pay out, and if they didn't, what was the decision of the ombudsman?

I'm not aware of cases where an insurer has successfully avoided paying out due to lack of building regulations. In fact there was a case where almost the opposite happened; the homeowner didn't declare additional bedrooms and argued that because they had no building regs they weren't really rooms - [https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/family-financial-ruin-insurers-refuse-1392958](https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/family-financial-ruin-insurers-refuse-1392958). The ombudsman decided the insurer was correct.

If they don't ask you, you declare all information honestly, and it's not part of the policy wording, it can't be unilaterally added as an exclusion at the point of claiming.

In fact, even when there has been a clause and the insurers have relied on it, the ombudsman has sided with the homeowner - [https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/decision/DRN2230292.pdf](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/decision/DRN2230292.pdf)

You think someone is going to start looking up plans to see which curbs are dropped legally and which are not? In fact, I have no idea where you even find out information about dropped curbs.

People park in front of curbs where someone has not dropped it, but having a dropped curb is different to just parking on your front garden and putting a block on wood in the road to make it easier to mount the pavement..."

Underpinning during extension works but no building control paperwork,frutbunn,1,"Underpinning is carried out to existing structures, it would only be part of the new extension if the new extension was constructed on top of an existing structure  which had inadequate existing foundation for the increased loading., for example a first floor extension.  
B Regs/byelaws have been around since 1858, even earlier in London.  
You need to establish why B control have not signed it of.  Did they not apply for B Regs or did they apply and not have the work in progress inspected or has a completion inspection being carried out but there are outstanding works or is that they simply did not request the completion inspection?  The latter is actually very common."

FTB and Completed - Advice on Utilities and Council Tax,UK_FinHouAcc,2,"> have the details from the previous owners, who their current Gas, Electric and Water supplier is, do I just call them up to let them know, we took possession of the house yesterday, do they take our details so they can start a new account in our name?

Take meter readings of the gas and electricity and have that ready when you call the current suppliers and set up an account. Do not let them get you into a contract, go with a standard tariff and then check [Moneysavingexpert.com](http://Moneysavingexpert.com) to see if you can get a better deal. There are no ma ny but it is possible. 

Set up a new account with the water companies (some places have water in and water out as separate so check that).

Contact the council and set up an account, they will tell you the ways you can pay,

>Broadband, I am just searching for deals and won't install until we are ready to move in so any ideal, how to get the best deal?

Use comparison sites or TopCashback, have the postcode and address to hand and see what is available. You could ask virgin to see what they will do but compare as well.

>Also, we don't watch TV, I normally use youtube or netflix or download my shows so never is the need to watch live tv so I have no need for a TV License. How can I go about and just cancelling this as I think the previous owner, they have freeview or some connection in the living room but we don't really use this or want it.

Check on the tv licence website, watching live stuff on Youtube is still live TV but anyway check with them and if you really don't need it you can register that fact, it stops them hassling you.... for a while."
FTB and Completed - Advice on Utilities and Council Tax,MomoSkywalker,1,"Thank you so much for the explanation. I am looking for broadband deals now. And I don't watch live TV on youtube anyway, most of the shows I watch is USA, Canada shows and I just download them so its not worth me paying for a tv license if I don't need one and I can always pay if we do watch live tv again. 

  
I will contact the council on Monday and speak to them about setting a council tax account. 

  
Ok, will take the meter readings and will call them up. Standard tarriff, its this like a monthly contact?

  
Thank you again for the help."
FTB and Completed - Advice on Utilities and Council Tax,UK_FinHouAcc,1,">Ok, will take the meter readings and will call them up. Standard tarriff, its this like a monthly contact

Ok it gets a bit complicated, But you will have either a pay as you go where you top up the meter with credit put onto a stick,card or via the internet. Or a credit meter where you set up an account and can either pay on receipt of the bill or pay a set amount per month and that builds credit in summer for use in winter.

A standard tariff on a credit meter will be something like that but is usually more expensive than being locked in to a deal, but a deal will have exit fees. A standard tariff won't.

So, I am assuming you have a credit meter, give the company a call say you want to set up an account on a standard tariff with 'pay on receipt of a bill'. Once that is all set up look on moneysaving [expert.com](http://expert.com) form better deals.

In fact using that website as a source for new home info and comparisons is not a bad idea."
FTB and Completed - Advice on Utilities and Council Tax,MomoSkywalker,2,"Oh I understand, thank you, that makes sense. I will differently do that and then shop around for an better deals or see what kind of deal the current providers provide. Thank you, you have been a big help on this matter....will work to get this all sorted out on Monday and then hopefully in a few weeks, we will be locked in a better deal. Cheers."

Buying a house with a loft room without building regs,Routine-Product597,2,"I never had any issues buying or selling mine even though it was a 1 bed with loft space technically (paid less because of this). I had an indemnity policy on the loft conversion due to no regs (it had been there a long time, likely pre-building regs) which satisfied the lender. I would never want to own a property with a loft conversion again due to the mould issues I had though, and also the anxiety of struggling to sell. At a minimum request an indemnity policy"
Buying a house with a loft room without building regs,roxieh,4,"This is tricky. I bought a 3 bed with a converted loft room without BR. It has proper stairs, carpets, radiators, lights, velux windows. However. It was marketed as storage only and that's how we use it. 


 A converted room without BR cannot be marketed or USED as **livable space** for insurance purposes. Livable space refers to using it for everyday use, eg bedroom, office, spare room, games room, basically anything that would be classed as you actually using the room as part of your house. Which if you made it into an office that would fall under. 


 We were able to get insurance on the grounds of the converted room being storage only, but in your circumstance because it has an en suite bathroom and is quite clearly being used for livable space, no insurance company would touch it which would mean you wouldn't be able to get a mortgage on it (assuming you tell everyone the truth and do things by the book). 


 Without BR, I wouldn't proceed. I'd be asking the seller to get retrospective BR. "

Best way to proceed given no building regulations for an attic room?,ex0-,4,"> Whilst I have an AIP both from Barclays (& another from L&C), how can I get confirmation that they would provide a loan for the property without building regulations? (e.g. if it had indemnity insurance)

You wouldn't, your solicitor represents the legal interests of the lender. They will deal with it.

> Indemnity insurance aside, how will no building regulations affect home insurance in general? If the attic decides to magically start to crumble one day, am I right in assuming that home insurance will not cover any of it?

This would depend on the policy you obtain but given the attic room has been in place for donkeys years I can't imagine it'd cause any issues.

> leave it to the solicitors

Absolutely, yes. This is what you're paying for.

> If I take out Home Buyers Protection insurance, will it cover me for all fees if I decide to ""conveniently withdraw"" after the solicitors point out the lack of building regulations further down the line?

It won't cover all your fees, they never do. The specifics of what is covered will depend on the insurance policy you purchase."
Best way to proceed given no building regulations for an attic room?,uthinkilltellu,1,"Has the loft conversion changed the shape / structure of the room? If they have just boarded it and put some velux windows in then they won’t (normally) need planning person as it’s permitted development. If they changed the roof shape then planning permission would have been required, but as it was done a long time ago probably no one cared to raise it and the planning office probably won’t care about it unless you tell them. 

Also as they dont claim it as a 4th bedroom it shouldn’t be a problem to get a mortgage on the property. When you sell it you won’t be able to call it a 4th bedroom either though"

"Just bought my first home, pick up the keys in a few days, what are the first things I need to take care of?",Revolutionary-Permit,6,"Take meter readings the day you get the keys. It's OK if it takes a week or so to get your account set up, so don't worry about phoning the supplier as soon as you're in the house. Given energy companies aren't really taking on new customers right now, you'll just need to set up an account with the current supplier (my supplier is confirmed in my fixtures & fittings form).

Set up your water bill. If you're on a meter, take a reading if you can access it. A quick Google will tell you who supplies water in your area if you don't know.

Set up your council tax account, you can normally do this on the council website.

Changing the locks is a good idea, although I don't think as many people do this as who give out this advice.

Update your address on bank and credit cards, electoral roll, driving licence, and on websites you use for delivery often (Amazon, take away places, etc)."

First time buyers & water leaks,SAP1987,3,"If it's that much of a slow leak, why not wait until you have access. It won't rain forever."
First time buyers & water leaks,dweenimus,3,Just find a local plumber who can fit a stop tap in the actual property. You can normally turn these off in the street also...
First time buyers & water leaks,[deleted],2,"can you provide some pics? I'm having a real hard time visualising the set up you describe - it simply sounds odd from start to finish.

1. a shared external stop tap is unusual - are you on a meter?
2. a shared internal stop tap is pretty much unheard of, why not shut down internally (my guess - you haven't bothered locating it)
3. having this locked up and no access is even weirder
4. a decent plumber or handyman would simply nip up a slow leaking radiator and 99% of the time this fixes the issue without needing to shut down the water
5. yes, rain can swell a door but again, hard to believe a semi competent handyman can't get it open. typically it would be getting it closed again that's the problem
6. the nonsense about waiting for it to dry out is basically a fob off imo
7. I honestly feel you are making a mountain out of a molehill - probably because people are messing you around

Also - why are you relying on your neighbors to hire a handyman? She may not even have hired someone, why not hire one yourself if it's a shared access lockup."
First time buyers & water leaks,M4niac81,2,"I'd just take a crowbar to the door and get it open, then all your problems are solved regarding access to the water stopcock. It might do a little damage to the edge of the door but it shouldn't be too bad. It's just as much your right to do this as anyone if your services are in that room. 

This really isn't a bad problem, you just have to take some initiative and don't rely so much on others. You're a home owner now, don't rest until the problems are sorted, stop waiting around!"
First time buyers & water leaks,devotchkaa,2,"1 & 2 - There are two stop taps in the same room, it's a semi detached house & the shared access cupboard with the water metres & stop taps is between the houses. Please [excuse the terrible drawing](https://imgur.com/a/MqSFj5A)

3. It hasn't been locked until the last few months, delivery people kept putting parcels in there & the neighbour didn't like it so she locked it up. She apparently lost her key & none of the keys we had can open it because it was such an old lock that shouldn't have ever been locked.

4. The 1st leak seems to be coming from behind the radiator potentially through the wall that joins the shared access water metre room.

5. I can't express how swollen this door is, I took a pry bar to it today just before making the post & couldn't find any purchase whatsoever. At this point I'd be happy breaking the door down so we can get access.

6&7. I agree!! It should not be this difficult to get into a room & it's becoming a way bigger deal than it needs to be.

8. We've tried hiring our own but the door & room are on our neighbours' property so the handy men we've spoken to don't want to touch it! We've tried to get her to confirm in writing that we have access but she's 80+, doesn't have a mobile phone & when I've repeatedly asked if we can send someone round she insists she'll sort it. I have the deeds & housing registry but none of it mentions the shared access room so we can't use it as proof to bypass her."
First time buyers & water leaks,M4niac81,2,"Get a hammer with that pry bar and drive it into the gap, the wood will split a little bit, but once you have it in a bit, pull it, kick it, thump it with the hammer, whatever you have to do, eventually it'll open. You might mess the door or the frame up a bit but I guarantee you can get it open. Don't mess about, you'll have to use some force but it will open. Also are you certain the lock is undone? Have you absolutely checked, don't assume. I've crowbarred open a ""stuck"" door once only to find the lock worked the opposite way around to what I'd expected so it was merely locked and not stuck, doh!"
First time buyers & water leaks,devotchkaa,1,"You're right, I need to put on my big girl pants & really get in there. The wood's definitely going to split but I'd rather deal with a broken door than letting the leak(s) get worse. It's probably going to need to be replaced it's in such bad shape anyway. 

Yeah it's definitely unlocking, there's a new key that turns fully & clicks in the lock.

Thanks for your advice, homeowner life is stressful."

So lets say they did a survey and thought it was worth 220k, they will come back saying 185k if that's what you offered, now it's got 1 less room so they think it's worth 190k, still over 185k, so they still say 185k.

"2 bed - 185k valuation - due to no regs - now 1 bed, still valued at 185k by bank...",alec-gullon,3,"There was a case where an insurance claim was rejected on the basis of the house being underinsured. The homeowners had insured it on the understanding that it was a 3-bed, since it was advertised that way when they bought it, but they were using its unregulated loft as an extra bedroom. The ombudsman ruled that they were underinsured and upheld the rejection of the claim. 

Basically, the law isn’t as simple as regulations = bedroom when it comes to determining what can and cannot be used as a bedroom, and common sense dictates that if somebody is willingly using a room as a bedroom, it probably is a bedroom, regardless of whether or not it has regulations.

I imagine this is what OP is referring to.

Advertising rooms that are physically capable of being a bedroom as just “loft rooms” and removing them from the bedroom count is simply estate agent language that assists window shoppers in quickly understanding the reality of what is on offer. If a room has a bed in it, can be powered and kept cosy and warm, and has easy access, then it is a bedroom. End of. Potentially unsafe in the event of a fire, perhaps structurally unsound and very occasionally an ongoing legal issue - but nevertheless, it _is_ a bedroom. It just has a lot of asterisk marks next to its name.

It’s up to you if you want to put a bed in your dining room and call it a bedroom, but it wouldn’t affect the value of the house, because you don’t magically gain extra space by doing this, you just trade a dining room for a bedroom."
"2 bed - 185k valuation - due to no regs - now 1 bed, still valued at 185k by bank...",itallstartedwithapub,1,"I'm not saying it's reasonable or not, I'm saying your lender has decided that, at this price, this property is a reasonable purchase. You can say that's wrong, but that's your lender's viewpoint.

As far as I know there has never been an insurance ombudsman case where lack of building regulations alone has completely voided a home insurance policy. There was a case where the ombudsman decided that the property was underinsured though - the homeowner argued that the loft conversion was not a bedroom because of lack of building regs, the insurer said it's obviously still a bedroom and the ombudsman agreed."
"2 bed - 185k valuation - due to no regs - now 1 bed, still valued at 185k by bank...",flameonkayser,-39,"It does not matter, question is about something else"
"2 bed - 185k valuation - due to no regs - now 1 bed, still valued at 185k by bank...",itallstartedwithapub,5,"Yup that's the one. I don't know why people cling on to the idea that building control decides what a bedroom is.

A hallway obviously isn't a bedroom.

A loft conversion used as a bedroom is clearly a bedroom."

If your flooring has got fucked up then talk to the neighbour and maybe involve insurance but if it’s a small drip as you describe there’s nothing for insurance to do. Depending on the type of light fitting you might want to get an electrician to take a look at it if water could collect in it, if it’s just a bulb and there’s nowhere for water to collect then it’s probably not even worth the hassle."
