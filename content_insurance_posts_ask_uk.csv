Damp and contents insurance ,dzkc4182,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bbfoy7/damp_and_contents_insurance/,"(England)

Hi,

Suspect I know the answer to this already, but thought it was worth asking.

We've had an issue with a leak for over two months (I suspect caused by my landlords handyman working on the toilet). 

I've been running a dehumidifier nonstop and trying to reduce any moisture I create, but it's still going.

He has been glacially slow fixing this, and now the included appliances are failing as there's water everywhere.

I'm frankly not interested in his appliances - they're on him for not bothering to fix this. I am bothered about my belongings, but stupidly never signed up for contents insurance.

I expect I wouldn't, but if I did get some insurance now would I be covered for any damage to my things given this leak has been going on for so long?

Thanks "
Leasehold Buildings and Contents Insurance,SandyArbuthnot,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/18i5wdx/leasehold_buildings_and_contents_insurance/,"I've recently completed on a flat purchase (yay!) which is a leasehold flat.

The management company has buildings insurance, so I don't legally need to take out my own policy.

However, I want accidental damage cover for things that are not contents, e.g. drilling through a pipe, accidental damage to the kitchen counters/appliances etc.

It seems the only way to do this is to take out buildings insurance, including accidental damage cover within that.

TL;DR it looks like there are 4 categories of insurance:

1. Buildings Insurance
2. Accidental cover for Buildings (only possible if you take out 1.)
3. Contents Insurance
4. Accidental cover for Contents (only possible if you take out 3.)

I only need items 2 to 4, but to get 2, I have to take out 1.  


Other leaseholders - has this been your experience?

Cheers in advance."

Does my contents insurance cover damage to the flat below if my washing machine floods?,devtastic,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bvrax9/does_my_contents_insurance_cover_damage_to_the/,"This is really another version of ""what insurance do I need for my flat in England?"". 

* I know the freeholder's building insurance covers a lot of leaks in communal areas, but definitely not pipes or the washing machine within my flat. 
* I assume that if my washing machine flooded and damaged my flat then my contents insurance would cover all or some of that damage.
* My question is: If the water damaged the flat downstairs would that damage also be covered by my contents insurance? Would it act a bit like third party insurance for a car?

I'm surprised how hard it is to find an answer to this. There are posts here covering similar scenarios, but they are the mostly from the perspective on the leaked on rather than the leaker, or they don't specify what type of insurance was involved, or they end up as a general discussion about buildings insurance vs contents insurance.

I just want to understand if my contents insurance would only cover damage to my contents or whether it would also cover third party damage, i.e, the flat downstairs. If my washing machine flooded and brought the ceiling down in the flat below would my contents insurance cover that?

I'm hoping this is the right place to ask this.

I rent in London from a ""charitable foundation"". They have recently emailed us to let us know that there will be restorative building work going on later this year which occurs every 5 or 6 years.

In this email they have told us how there will be scaffolding on the front and rear of the property which will be secured with alarms etc and police informed. They have advised us to inform our contents insurers of this work happening. 

I have received a reply from Urban Jungle saying they cannot cover us for the duration of this work (around 5 months) and I can cancel, then restart my policy when it's finished. 

Is this a norm in the insurance game? Does anybody know if there are contents insurance which will cover me? Or have you had any experience with this sort of thing?

Combining buildings/contents insurance,Tomathee87,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/l9zri0/combining_buildingscontents_insurance/,"Hi, signposted here as maybe the right place to ask, apologies if not...

My first place was a flat that only needed contents insurance. When we bought a house we naturally needed buildings insurance as well. The contents runs from February annually (moved into flat), the buildings from September (moved into house) annually. I want to combine them as some places do discount for taking out both, and also to reduce paperwork and time spent browsing twice a year, I also think I may have fallen into the trap of paying for stuff like home emergency cover on both. I couldn't find anything on either of the current insurers website about renewing for part of a year so both expire together and renewal can be done on both jointly, and I don't want to overlap and pay for two policies, and I assume if I cancel part way through the year there's no part refund.

Looking for suggestions please? (been going on for the last three years/6 times I've had a renewal letter so partly on me for not dealing with sooner).

We have just given notice on the house we have lived in for 2 years with the landlord. 


A couple of weeks ago, we noticed that a crack had appeared on the induction hob. The hob still works fine, but the crack is noticeable. We don't know how it happened but admit that we must have caused the damage somehow - possibly while packing up the kitchen. The oven is a built in oven and came as part of the property. 


The landlord came to inspect the property today and he has asked us to make a claim through our own home contents insurance for accidental damage for the hob.


I am hesitant to do this as the hob is a fixture of the property and is not ours, so I don't think it's right that we should have to claim for this. If we do have to claim, then we will lose our no claims bonus and have to pay the excess for this. Although the damage was done by us, I feel the money for the repairs should come either out of our deposit or be claimed through the landlords insurance, rather than our own. 


I don't want to be awkward if this is normal, but it just doesn't seem right to me. Does anyone know if this is commonplace or what the normal process should be so we can decide what would be best to do? Any advise would be much appreciated."

We're one of 6 plots/houses in East London, sharing a private communal garden/pathway which is quite large. The developers are in the process of transferring the area over to a jointly managed limited company, with a 'director' appointed from each house.

The policy the developer took out whilst building the properties is due to expire this week and we have the option to renew. The proposed insurance covers up to £37k for shared buildings e.g. the bin shed, gates, lights, fences, paving etc. and protection should someone injure themselves from our collective negligence (which I find highly improbable).

The policy protects against: ""*Fire, Lightning, Explosion, Aircraft or other aerial devices or articles dropped from them, Riot, Civil Commotion, Strikers, Locked-out workers, Persons taking part in labour disturbances, Malicious Persons, Theft, Earthquake, Storm, Flood, Escape of Water from any tank, apparatus or pipe, leakage of oil from any fixed heating installation, Impact by any road vehicle or animal, Accidental Damage, Subsidence.*""

The policy is £420 with some excesses ranging from £500 to £1,500. As we're a fully residential area with only a gardener who comes to garden once every 2 weeks during the spring and summer months, I personally can't see the point in it but perhaps i'm not seeing the need for it?

I'm a new shared ownership leaseholder (FTB) looking to arrange contents insurance. Under the terms of my shared ownership lease, I'm responsible for wooden flooring, plasterwork, pipes, sanitary ware etc - basically anything other than load bearing walls and building structure.

There is one other maisonette in the property. There is a common front door, communal lobby and then 1 internal front door for each property. I have contents insurance but the buildings insurance is managed by the freeholder.

We were burgled a couple of weeks back and during the break in our internal front door was kicked down. We made a contents insurance claim for our belongings which went through successfully, and paid for a new door to be fitted as it was no longer secure.

  
We've tried to claim back the cost of our new door via the freeholder through the buildings insurance, but the freeholder is disputing that this is a buildings insurance claim - but rather a contents claim. After speaking to my contents insurer - they dispute this as it's part of the building.

  
Citizens advice weren't very useful and I need to wait 2 weeks to speak to the leasehold advisory service. I can't speak about the buildings insurance policy with the insurer as I'm not the policy holder.

  
My question is - is there any chance that I am responsible for this internal door, or is the freeholder being a chancer? I feel like I'm beginning to exhaust all avenues for getting this resolved.

Landlord wants us to replace flooring via insurance,Anthelios50,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/150av0v/landlord_wants_us_to_replace_flooring_via/,"Been renting a house for the past 5 years, there's cheap laminate flooring all throughout the downstairs. The floor wasn't in great condition in parts when we moved in - big gaps between the boards, however since a leak from a shower upstairs the flooring has become much worse and it has swelled and now the planks are no longer flush and the edges are protruding and the boards are chipping and disintrating at the edges. Makes it very hard to clean.

Have flagged this with the landlord numerous times.

Now they have asked us to replace the flooring via our insurance.

Am I right in thinking that this is mental?

1.) We don't have insurance and if we did, surely this would only cover our contents and not the house itself?

2.) Contents insurance wouldn't cover fixtures and fittings?

3.) Even if we did have insurance, I don't think you can claim on something you don't own / have a vested financial interest in?

Kitchen door stuck and unable to access food / cooking utilities - can I claim food expenses back from letting agency?,InstigatedApprentice,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1e3rvts/kitchen_door_stuck_and_unable_to_access_food/,"Discovered last night that my kitchen door is completely stuck. It's a big heavy fire door with no way to access the hinges from either side, so I can't take it off. I think the bolt is stuck in the frame and it doesn't seem to be pulling back when I move the handle.

As a result, I called my letting agency this morning and told them about the issue, and that we can't access our food. They said they would let the landlord know, but didn't provide an estimated response time.

I thought maybe I'd be able to claim back food expenses through my contents insurance but because it's a building issue and it's not a contents issue, they said I'd have to talk to my letting agency about. 

Are they legally responsible to cover our food costs until they fix our door?"
Claiming an insurance when loft is missing a B reg,Careful_Sort_9210,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1d4rmvf/claiming_an_insurance_when_loft_is_missing_a_b_reg/,"The house is advertised as having 4 bedrooms, including a loft dormer that was added decades ago.

The room looks sturdy and stayed for all these years, not sure about insulation though, but there is no planning permission or building regulations documentation available for the loft conversion.

Should I inform the insurer that the house is a 3-bedroom property with an additional loft room when getting insured?

What are the chances that an insurer will refuse to pay a claim, such as for fire damage, because the loft does not have the necessary building regulations approval?

While the lender and solicitor seem satisfied with indemnity insurance, my real concern is the possibility of never securing building or contents insurance for the house.

Even if I do obtain insurance, I guess the insurer might use the lack of building regulations as a reason to avoid paying out on a claim."
How do I stop my landlord giving master keys to contractors & telling them to let themselves in to my flat? 20+ visits per year.,EngineerInevitable49,271,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1dxip7d/how_do_i_stop_my_landlord_giving_master_keys_to/,"I live in a privately rented flat.  It’s in a purpose-built block of flats (Build to Rent).  Our building (which has around 250 flats in today) receives an enormous number of visits from contractors for various inspections, tests, checks etc.  Approximately 25 visits per year. 
On these visits, the property manager just hands out master keys to these contractors and ivvites them to let themselves into people’s flats unsupervised.  I’ve seen them in action — the ones I’ve seen did not even knock, they just opened people’s doors and went right in without warning.  One female neighbour came out of her shower naked to find a contractor standing in her flat who’d let himself in.  Tenants frequently come home to their front door unlocked because the contractor has not bothered to lock the door after leaving.

A few days ago I was in the lobby of the building and a man ran up to me, said he was in a hurry to get to his next job and dropped some keys into my hand.  I immediately explained to him that I’m not a member of staff and cannot accept the keys.  He just left, leaving me with the keys.  No staff were around. 

I decided to see whether these keys opened the door to my flat.  They did.  I then asked my neighbour to test them on his flat.  They opened his flat too.  So this contractor had just handed a master key giving me access to every flat in the building, despite KNOWING I’m not a member of staff.  For all he knew I could have been some random stranger who’d just walked in off the street or I could have just been someone delivering parcels or something. 

I feel so unsafe and I’m not sure what to do. I’m a single woman living alone and I’m a survivor of domestic abuse.  It terrifies me that so little care is taken over the way keys to our homes are doled out to people.

I have asked property management whether these contractors have had criminal background checks and they’ve refused to answer the question.

I’m also concerned about my possessions.  If these contractors steal or break anything, I don’t know whether my home contents insurance would cover it given that the contractor has been give a key (against my will of course) to just let themselves into my home as they please?
Any advice?"

New Build Insurance,_ProfessionalGoogler,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1dflq4n/new_build_insurance/,"Does anyone know how building/contents insurance works when you’re buying a new build? We’re about to exchange but just getting our last few ducks in a row before we fully commit.

I’ve tried a few different sites and for some it says they can’t insure us and we need specialist insurance. The quote from the specialist insurance was nearly £3k!
I did a quote with Moneysupermarket and they were all coming out at around £300.

Does anyone know the reason for the massive difference? I don’t want to just get the £300 one and find out later that it wasn’t correct and we’re not insured. But also I’m not really game for £3k for insurance so may rethink the house.

The only difference I could see was that on one site the address wasn’t in the lookup and on moneysupermarket it was. Could it be as simple as that? The house won’t be complete until September. We don’t need insurance until completion but was just wanting to get an indication of the cost before we exchange and we can’t back out.

Doing quotes for a new build feels strange anyway because they ask things like ‘Has the property ever flooded?’. Can you just say no to this because afaik it hasn’t flooded while they’re building it but I don’t know the full flood history of some land? Again, don’t want to put the wrong thing and invalidate it.

Losing our home,mtriggs1,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/16dj0if/losing_our_home/,"Hi Reddit, I’ve not made many posts so please bear with me. Before it is said, I know it is our fault I am just looking for a way to not be homeless.

To begin, everything is in my partner’s name as I have not long moved in. We notified the landlord that I will be moving in and the response was that it’s okay, they just have to do some reference checks. This is not the problem. I am writing this in case the next steps involve any of this information.

I’ve been here for around a month and my partner and her dog already lived at the house. As we both love animals, and we wanted our dog to have a friend, we got a second dog. We assumed as we already had a dog, it would not be a problem for the landlord if we got a second. They’re both insured and have contents insurance as well as having a playpen, though they’re not destructive. This is where the problem lies, upon telling the landlord that we have got the second dog, he said that we have an 8 week notice to leave the house. I now know that we should’ve asked first but I just didn’t think, the dog we got was not being looked after and we just wanted him to have a friend and be safe. However, we now have 8 weeks to find a home otherwise we’ll be homeless, any advice or help would be very much appreciated. Thank you!

Do you pay for home insurance Extras like legal cover or accidental damage cover?,Ok_Pumpkin9588,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/185ti2x/do_you_pay_for_home_insurance_extras_like_legal/,"FTB here approaching exchange and trying to decide on the level of cover for the building and contents insurance. A bit unsure whether it’s worth going for things like legal cover or accidental damaged to buildings or contents. Is it commonplace to buy these extras with insurance? (I’m looking at More Than but I’m assuming all providers offer these extras)

  
An additional question I have is about the Level 3 buildings survey I had done as part of the purchase. If I was to claim on my home insurance later, would the insurer ask me to disclose the survey report? Nothing completely terrible came up in the survey but there were the usual things for a Victorian terrace like damp resulting from poor ventilation and cement pointing, electric/gas/drainage surveys recommended, windows and gutters need replacing soon, some fairly minor roof repairs needed (I’m planning to get the gutters and roof stuff done soon after moving in).

  
I’m just wondering if the fact that a number of fairly minor issues were flagged in the buildings survey would just give the insurer an excuse to decline any claim by saying that the house wasn’t in great state of repair anyway. So the cynic in me thinks that it might be best to get the minimum level of cover since the insurer would just find an excuse not to pay up if something happened.

  
But I have no first hand experience of buildings insurance, hence wondering what kind of products other people here for go for.

Question about having home insurance between exchange and completion ,PurpleRainOnTPlain,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1dazrkj/question_about_having_home_insurance_between/,"Hello,

I am due to exchange on a flat on Monday and would then have 1-2 weeks between exchange and completion. I have read that it's important to ensure you have home insurance from the point of exchange as by that point you are legally responsible for the property. But I'm a bit confused about what ""home insurance"" means.

It is a leasehold flat so the property has building insurance, paid for as part of the service charge. It is a requirement of my mortgage that the property has building insurance, so the fact my solicitor has not explicitly told me to take out insurance must mean they are satisfied that this would meet the mortgage requirements, right?

Is the above advice only referring to building insurance, or will I i also need to take out contents insurance from the exchange date onwards? What happens if for instance, during the gap between exchange and completion, there is a leak and that ruins the carpet? Or the boiler breaks?

I viewed the flat for a 'final' time 2 weeks ago as I was told we would be exchanging the following day, however a last minute issue in the chain delayed things. Everything seemed fine on that viewing, however I live a considerable distance away and it's not really feasible to do another viewing before Monday. If, on completion, it transpires that there are issues which weren't present when I last viewed it (for instance if the boiler were to break), how does this all play out and would it differ if the issue occurred before exchange versus after exchange and who has the onus of proof upon them?

I don't have any specific reasons to be concerned, but have read horror stories and so  am just feeling very unsure about this brief period where I am legally responsible for the property, but don't actually live there and have no control over things.

Thanks!"

Is the freehold price offered by our landlord on our leasehold house extortionate?,Double-Magazine2885,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ay0zff/is_the_freehold_price_offered_by_our_landlord_on/,"We bought a leasehold house for £460,000 in 2021. The lease began in 1893 and has 1869 years left on it now. The ground rent is £12 a year (though I note that the landlord refers to its extortionate insurance charge as ‘insurance rent’ on the insurance invoice). I asked to buy the freehold and was quoted in August 23 ‘a consideration of £8000 plus their survey fee £350+vat and legal fees £1,140+ vat’. I’ve tried online calculation tools and they come back with a £0 freehold valuation. 

I’m a bit (a lot ;p) overwhelmed by the information available, and I’m not sure which valuation basis we’d use to calculate our freehold value (original or special valuation basis) let alone how I can manually calculate it!?!

Our neighbour (who bought his freehold at a much lower price) was shocked at the price and advised that we should have served a notice instead of the polite request. He advised that we could let the 3 month offer from our landlord expire and then serve a notice. 

We have a very limited budget and we are now wondering whether it is prudent to employ a chartered surveyor to independently value the freehold and take this figure to the landlord to negotiate? But the landlord could still refuse an independent valuation therefore negating our extra expense? 

The issue we have with being leasehold is the extortionate insurance the landlord charges us - £1225 last year for fire cover only. With the cost of living impact in general it’s a struggle to pay this effectively pointless insurance on top of our existing house and contents insurance. I queried the figure and they said it was based on our house being valued at 1.5 million (rebuild). I challenged this as home insurance companies typically advise that the rebuild value is less than the house market value, but they wouldn’t budge, despite being told we have existing insurance, and told us that if we don’t like it our option is to buy the freehold.

Any thoughts on the best way to proceed would be greatly appreciated. And whether the 8k is a reasonable or extortionate charge? Thanks in advance :)

"How much of a red flag is ""flood zone 3""?",MustStayCalm,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/16pmojy/how_much_of_a_red_flag_is_flood_zone_3/,"FTB in England, and there is this leasehold property in London I'm interested in buying...

The mortgage broker referred me to an insurance broker to talk about insurance. I figure why not, I'll just get a quote for contents insurance. In the end, I don't get a quote at all and am told it's likely due to flood risk.

Flood risk had never occurred to me. So now I looked up the Environment Agency flood map for the location, and I see that the property is in flood zone 3. According to EA:

>Locations in flood zone 3 have a high probability of flooding. This means in any year land has a 1% or more chance of flooding from rivers, or a 0.5% or more chance of flooding from the sea.

Suddenly the highish £2100 service charge made more sense.

When I previously viewed the property next door, (in the same block) I got a copy of the service charge accounts because I wanted to see what I was paying for. I see that in 2022, 53% of the service charge collected from leaseholders was paying for insurance.

I've already paid £499 to Foxton's ""recommended"" mortgage broker - my first FTB mistake - and paid £400 to instruct a conveyancer. The mortgage broker will be portable to a different property, and the conveyancer hasn't done any work yet so maybe I can switch them over to a different property without any trouble...

How screwed will I be, and do I pull out of this purchase?

Addendum: I haven't paid for a survey yet, but if I did go ahead with this purchase I am definitely going to ask they comment on the flood risk. Also, although I have a separate allocated garage, my maisonette/flat is on the second floor with the front door entrance at ground floor."

I'm a first time buyer and would like someone more experienced to sanity check my understanding of the buying process, please. Apologies in advance for so many questions.

1. Make offer (subject to conditions such as surveys)
2. Provide proof of affordability (MIP, deposit)
3. Once offer is accepted by sellers, contract someone to do surveys. We'd also like to do a second viewing as we didn't have access to some spaces (shed, loft etc) in the first viewing
4. If survey results are acceptable, go ahead with applying for mortgate (or does this come before surveys?) 
5. Exchange missives 
6. Move in?

I'm very tempted for a survey because the house is \~60 years old and was extended/modified 5+ times.

Does this sound right? If my understanding is correct I can stop the process as long as it's before step 5? 

What sort of insurances do I need, and when to buy them? I've heard homebuyer's insurance is important in case anything unexpected happens. Do I need building/contents insurance at missives exchange, or from the date I move in?

Insuring a flat?,JollyPhysics1394,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/170ot8l/insuring_a_flat/,"Longish read; TLDR at the end!

Hi! Not sure this is the right forum for this question but here goes! I live in a block of flats (leasehold), moved in about ten years ago, the building itself is eighteen years old. When buying insurance I was told I can only get contents insurance, as I don’t technically own the building to get building insurance. We pay a monthly fee to a building maintenance company whose job it is to affect repairs to communal areas and the external face of the building.

My neighbour was in the process of having a new shower installed, during which some tiles needed to be removed. Apparently his plumber was aghast at what he saw underneath- very little waterproofing, wet/damp plasterboard and insulation, and not really enough timber battens for a wall of that type. He said that a single flaw in the mastic around the bathtub meant that water from the shower got in the walls and mucked everything up. The plumber thinks the issue was simply shoddy workmanship and corner-cutting on the part of the builder, and to fix the damage would cost at least £4000.

As the building is over ten years old, my neighbour has no recourse to seek damages from the builder, and because he has contents insurance only, it doesn’t cover the damage to the structure of the walls. The maintenance company can’t help as their contract doesn’t cover inside the individual flats (except for ducting and pipe work).

I’m now worried this could happen to me and end up having to fork out £4K to fix my walls. I have re-pointed my bathtub but am still worried about the state of the walls beneath the bathroom tiles. Is there any sort of insurance I could take out that would cover me for any such future damage?

My flat is in England.

TLDR, neighbour in block of flats just spent £4K to fix his ruined bathroom wall; how can I mitigate against the same issue befalling my flat?"

Can anybody tell me what bills to expect when I move into a house for the first month and when they have to be paid?,No_Reaction9432,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1curzow/can_anybody_tell_me_what_bills_to_expect_when_i/,"I'm in process of buying my first house and I'm trying to consider what costs to budget for and when they will need to be paid.

I have already considered the ""buying costs"" as such I think. So the mortgage deposit, the mortgage arrangement fee, survey and valuation, solicitor fees, building and contents insurance which I'll need to arrange and pay for before we exchange contracts, 1 month of rent overlap to ease the pressure of furnishing a house and getting it ready to live in. There won't be removal costs as such because I live in a furnished rental and there's nothing I can't take by car to the new house. I have budgeted for furniture, sofas, mattresses, appliances, bedding, curtains, cushions, wall art, mirrors, accessories etc.

After all this is paid for I should still have a sound emergency fund leftover so I'd like to think I have covered the big one off costs and left myself some wiggle room too.

What I'm wondering is about the regular costs and when they will start coming along. I don't have a move in date yet so it's not totally predictable. 

Mortgage- I have agreed the DD date will be on the 1st of the month and I know the first month will be higher by an amount depending how early in the month the completion date is. So the first payment will be a standard payment plus the interest for a portion of the previous month. Standard payment is going to be £1350 but I understand this could be up to £2400 for the first payment.

Council Tax- how will this work? I'll probably move in August or September and the council tax year ends in March. Will they just calculate the number of days remaining, divided that by 365 then multiply by the annual rate and divide that equally across the remaining months of the year? 

Water- call the water company and give them a reading. The house already has a water meter. What will happen regarding the bill? Will they estimate and then reduce or increase accordingly and when should I expect to make a payment to them after move in?

Gas and electricity- I understand there is already a smart meter present so assuming I stick with the same provider (which I probably will initially to save hassle) what will happen? It's a smart meter so do they need meter readings? Will they estimate a bill and then adjust accordingly or will the bill be in real time because it's a smart meter? When will they need to be paid?

Broadband- I'll probably get this from Vodafone so once it is set up what will happen? Monthly payments arranged to start the following month? 

Home and contents insurance will already have been paid upfront before moving in.

Is there anything I'm missing?

I'd appreciate timescales for when all these things will have to be paid and will the bills be higher initially etc?

Buildings Insurance Confusion,TheyAlwaysCome,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/159chwv/buildings_insurance_confusion/,"Hi all,

I have a mortgage offer with Virgin Money - on the declaration it has a clause which states ""you agree to keep the property insured until the loan is fully repaid"".

The house we're purchasing is a leasehold flat. The freeholder has a policy for Aviva ""Residential Property Owners Insurance"", of which a copy has been provided to us as part of the enquiries stage. I believe the current owner has been paying the premium for this.

My question is: As a leaseholder - What type of insurance policy is Virgin Money referring to? Do I need to take out my own Buildings Insurance Policy? And does the Freeholder's Aviva ""Residential Property Owners Insurance"" cover this clause?

And is it mandatory to have contents insurance to satisfy this clause as well?

How on earth do I work out the flat roof percentage? If I go from the 2d floor plan over 50% of the ""floor area"" is covered by a flat roof, but because it's a highly pitched roof, there's a lot of non-flat roof per square metre. I know I don't need to be millimetre accurate, but I've no idea if it's 30/40/50%  

2. The dormer roofs are mineral felt, the extension roof is fibreglass. It asks what the flat roof is made from but I can only pick one option. Do I enter fibreglass since the extension is the largest flat roof?  

3. Alongside the property address, it asks if the policy holders address is the same. I selected ""NO"" (because i don't live their yet) but then asks for a reason, none of which apply to me. Do I just pretend that's my address in this scenario? Will the current vendors get all my insurance paperwork in the post?  

4. I work from home, 100% remote and online, mostly employed work, but I do a bit on the side. Do I declare it as ""business use"" and select ""no visitors""?  

5. Cats/Dogs - We don't have any, but my partner does want a pet. Do I say ""no"" and then have to update it, or assume we'll get one and declare it now?  

6. Last one; Is it sensible to get contents insurance at the same time. Or would you just get the buildings insurance for now, and call them up to add contents once we're in?"
Found out about an unresolved insurance claim (subsidence) on the day of exchange,MrBish95,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/17gaj7r/found_out_about_an_unresolved_insurance_claim/,"Hi all, first time here.

Trying to buy my first house has been a stressful ordeal to say the least. 

Tiny bit of backstory.
The house I'm trying to buy is in a flood risk area, due to having a brook running across the bottom of the garden. I've been aware of that since the first viewing, and luckily managed to chat to the neighbour (who's lived there for 30 years) about the area. She said the gardens are the only thing that flood at this end of the street, the water has never risen enough to flood the house. I'm happy with this, and decide to move forward, make an offer, have it accepted, instruct solicitors blah blah blah. 

A ways down the road we get to the day of exchanging contracts, and I call up my insurers (Admiral) to get the final buildings + contents insurance in place, after getting approximately 5 quotes beforehand from different companies to keep NatWest happy. 

The guy on the phone gives me a price, the phone cuts off, he then called me back to tell me in actual fact he can't give me a quote over the phone, as there's a block on their system for this particular house due to an open/unresolved insurance claim from 2018 due to subsidence. This would have been a claim from the previous occupiers, not the couple I'm buying from now. 

I immediately called up my solicitors, and LUCKILY they hadn't exchanged contracts yet.

I hadn't been made aware of any subsidence at all along the way, only that the area may suffer from subsidence on the environmental searches. I've also not seen any evidence of it when I viewed the property. 

My solicitors have gone back to the sellers solicitors, and they say they're totally unaware of any insurance claims or subsidence. 

I'm now at a bit of a loss. 

I don't intend on exchanging and completing until I can find out if there has been, or is currently any subsidence at the property, but also, how to resolve this insurance claim? 

It is involving people who haven't lived at the property for over 2 years, and don't hold a policy there anymore either. 

I'm willing to get a structural engineer in to check the property, but I don't know how to resolve the insurance. Admiral won't give me any more information on the claim due to data protection, as it's not my policy/claim. Will Aviva (who the claim was made with) be able to tell me anymore? 

If anyone has any advice on this situation, I'd very much appreciate it!"
Can a leaseholder make a claim on a freeholder's buildings insurance?,Silver4443,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/wdfzkb/can_a_leaseholder_make_a_claim_on_a_freeholders/,"I am the leaseholder of a flat and a blocked drain caused the kitchen sink to flood, damaging the wood floor. I have contents insurance but the insurer tells me this damage is to the fabric of the building not the contents, and would therefore only be covered by buildings insurance.

I don't have buildings insurance of my own but the residents' association that manages the building on behalf of the freeholder does, and my service charge goes toward this. Is it (ever, or typically) possible to claim for this kind of thing on a freeholder's buildings insurance?

EDIT: to be clear, the drain blockage originated inside my flat, and the flooring is obviously my responsibility to get fixed, not the freeholders. That's why I'm not clear whether the collective buildings insurance would cover it."

Insurance question ,Equivalent_Pound_604,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ayzpe3/insurance_question/,"Hi everyone,

My partner and I were FTBs and have been in our first home for a month now. It’s a Victorian terraced house in need of A LOT of love. 

Since moving in I’ve experienced a lot of anxiety regarding the property, particularly in regards to the structure of it 

I know that these fears are unwarranted as we had a level 3 survey carried out which found the house to be fine. However due to the age of the house and the constant creaking I have nightmares about the ceiling caving in.

From what I’ve seen of others posts, it seams fairly normal to have these worries when moving in to your first house having rented all your life. 

Something that would put my mind at ease would be to know whether, say in the worst case scenario, the ceiling fell in randomly, would this be covered by home insurance? We have Admiral basic home/contents insurance but I’m thinking of upgrading to something else to peace of mind. 

Any advice on overcoming these initial anxieties would be much appreciated, thanks! "

What did you do in regards to your mailing address?

We’ve already set up a mail redirection so we will still get anything sent to our old address and I’m fine with that for non-official things, but I’m not sure if I should be changing stuff like car registration, electoral records, bank etc when we’re only going to be staying in the AirBNB for 2-3 months. 

We know it’s not going to be a short period as even when we complete we need to do some repairs in our new place, but we’re not sure exactly how long and therefore if it’s worth moving things. 

I guess for something like our car we’d have to update the DVLA/our car insurance to still be covered? Same with our contents insurance. Not sure if there’s any other companies/government entities to take into account. 

Do you think it would cause any issues with the host of the Airbnb (it’s a company) for moving our residence there?

ELI5… house insurance when selling and buying,soulvacation,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/15s4grm/eli5_house_insurance_when_selling_and_buying/,"We have buildings + contents insurance on our current home. That renewed in August (I’m hoping I can get it partially refunded or switch it to the new house when we complete as obviously we hopefully won’t need it for a year, I know I should have checked this already). We are hoping to exchange soon and complete in September some time.

Do people in a chain generally buy a new policy for their new house and cancel their old policy, or switch their existing policy to their new house? However between exchange and completion you have to be insuring two properties (old and new) at the same time, right? As you have interest in both? So I can’t switch my insurance over completely until completion?

Are their places that do short term insurance just for the period between exchange and completion?

FTB - is this financially do able?,OCreates,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ds2vh0/ftb_is_this_financially_do_able/,"

Hi all,

My wife and I are looking at a shared ownership house being built nearby. It’s a 3 bed, full value being £345,000. 

We’re looking at getting a 40% share for £138,000. 

Rent would then be £431 on the remaining 60% share. 

Service charge would be £106 pcm. 

My wife works 3 days a week as a teacher and earns £23,500. I am looking at a career change and have accepted a job for £24,000. (If I stayed in my current career, I could earn a fair bit more between 40k-60k but I don’t enjoy the work)

We currently have 27,000 saved and would be looking at putting 20,700 down as a deposit (15%). 

I am also getting a £13,000 tax free lump sum in October from my current job. 

We have a balance of 0 on credit cards, 0 loans and nothing on finance. We don’t go on holidays and do any extravagant spending. 

Making a general budget of absolute essentials but also artificially inflated higher costs. Ie, we currently spend about 240 a month on food but have put on our own budget 300. (food, petrol, phone connections, teacher union, car insurance and tax, nursery, gas & electric, water, life insurance, council tax, internet and contents insurance.) we’re looking at spending around 2,500 a month. Whilst we don’t know our exact monthly figures and what we’ll earn, on our own personal spreadsheet I have stated that both of our monthly income will be less than expected at £1,500 so a total of 3,000 a month. 

That should leave us with a minimum of £500 disposable income after everything. I understand the 50/30/20 rule and know we’re well over the 50% here. That said, we will also have an emergency fund left over, my wife can increase her hours to 4 days a week and I would like to think I can progress in the new career with qualifications. We spend 95% of our free time at home and feel that shared ownership is our only option to stay in our local area without compromising on essentials and size. We can also see ourselves living here long term and won’t feel like upgrading in 5 - 10 years. 

Long term plan, my wife will go up to 4 days a week (when our son is in school) and hopefully with career progression I will have a better wage. One day, we would like to staircase to 100%. 

Is this reasonable? What are your thoughts on our situation? We are fully aware that the start will be a bit of a struggle and things can change but I’d like to think we’ve thought about everything. "
Which buildings insurance do I get to complement my service charge buildings insurance?,Thenon,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/nvyw8s/which_buildings_insurance_do_i_get_to_complement/,"I have a question about buildings insurance. If this belongs in a different subreddit instead, please let me know.  


I recently bought and moved into an ex-council flat in London. In case of a burst pipe or fire damage, I want an insurance that covers the costs of fixing such damage.  


 I understand that I need two types of insurance: Buildings insurance and Contents insurance.

1. Contents insurance covers the cost of any contents damaged as a result. For example, if the burst pipe causes a flood and that flood breaks my laptop, then the contents insurance will cover the cost of the laptop. However, it will not cover the cost of fixing the pipe or any resulting damage to the floors below.
2. Buildings insurance. This would cover any non-contents damage, such as fixing the pipe or damage to the floor below.

&#x200B;

Long story short, I am planning to skip contents insurance. Most of the valuable items in our flat are covered by my business insurance (I am videographer and have expensive camera equipment). The remaining value of all our items is under £10k. We are on the second floor with lockable windows and not in a flood zone.

&#x200B;

The question I have is about buildings insurance. As I am a leaseholder, I pay an annual service charge, about £300 of which goes to building insurance that the freeholder has organised. I don't want to buy my own standard buildings insurance, because I believe that there is overlap between the building insurance from the freeholder and hence I will be overpaying for things that are already covered.  


However, I strongly suspect that this service charge building insurance does not cover everything. If the roof breaks or if the communal boiler in the basement breaks, then I hope the freeholder's buildings insurance will cover that.  


However, if a pipe bursts in my own kitchen or if the fuse blows because I drilled a hole in the wrong place, then I suspect that the freeholder's insurance will not cover that. Hence, I am looking for a buildings insurance that covers those things. But I do NOT want to pay a premium to also cover the things that the freeholder has already covered.  


Does that make sense? Do you have any tips?  


I thought that my situation is fairly common, a lot of leaseholders in London have some kind of buildings insurance included in their service charge. However, I spent some time online making insurance quotes and also called up one company for a long discussion and they didn't seem to offer this.  


Thank you in advance."

Extension without building permission and no indemnity cover! HELP,GroundbreakingTry771,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bo0poc/extension_without_building_permission_and_no/,"Will try and keep this brief. We’re in the process of buying and our solicitors were on the final enquiry before exchange. Our sellers had a small extension (literally 1.4m x 2m) which was built during Covid. They didn’t get a council officer to do the check during the built of it so therefore it isn’t to building regulations. 
When our solicitors asked for the paperwork from our sellers solicitors, our sellers panicked and went to the council asking for the paperwork. Obviously the council couldn’t provide it as they never approved it or had seen the building of it. They claim that the council have agreed they will NOT take enforcement actions. But now because they’ve gone to the council, they can’t take indemnity cover!! 
Our sellers are willing to get a structural engineer to show that it is to building regs. But there is still no indemnity cover.
Our solicitors has asked us if we’ve happy to continue if a structural engineer provides a certificate however our lender also needs to be happy with this. We would also want a confirmation from the council in writing they will not take enforcement actions. 
But I’m abit worried about this and I don’t really know if we should continue with the purchase so has anyone has this happen to them. This will clearly affect us when we want to sell the property unless we destroy it and rebuild the extension. Will we still be liable for building and contents insurance. 
Any help or advice. Should we be running away from this purchase?"

Hi,

Hoping for some advice. Apologies if this is outside of the scope of the group.

I’m based in the UK and bought a house at the beginning of August which is when the buildings and contents insurance started.

My family and I were expecting to move straight in but unfortunately we ended up having to get the place rewired, plastered throughout and on and on.  There have been unforeseen delays throughout the process.

We’re having it re-roofed on 23/10 and I thought it would be prudent to inform the insurance company of the work that would be commencing. I did this tonight via live chat.

During this conversation I was asked if my family and I were occupying the property and I said “not yet, as we’re still getting work done and decorating”.

The live chat agent then told me they would have to cancel the policy, as when the policy was taken out we stated that it would be occupied.

I informed them that I had been staying overnight in the property a couple of nights a week, but at this point the damage was done and they now want me to call to process the cancellation.

This insurance was arranged via an agent who I will be calling in the morning to seek advice from but obviously I am now concerned about the ramifications this may have on the mortgage and future home insurance.

It may be worth mentioning that we’re staying at my parents house which is 5 minutes away and that someone has been present at the property every day since the completion date. 

I’m hoping that it will be clear that this was all a misunderstanding and there’s a way to navigate out of this mess that doesn’t jeopardise the mortgage. Just wondering if anyone has had experience with this scenario before.

Cheers!"

Should I renegotiate my offer?,Lumpy-Experience1179,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bz7y78/should_i_renegotiate_my_offer/,"Hi,

FTB here! 

I just got my survey back... For context the flat is a share of freehold and has internal communal areas. According to legislation all flats which open to internal communal areas require a fire door - the flat I’m in the process of buying doesn’t have a fire door so this invalidates property and contents insurance. I think I’ll need to get a bespoke fire door because there’s an extra panel to the left where the letter box is and the letter box also doesn’t comply with fire regs. 

Its difficult to get a quote without the specific measurements to then negotiate but I think it’ll cost around £2,000 - £2.5 max to supply and fit a bespoke door. Do you think its worth renegotiating my offer price by £2.5k? Also its my own estimate so I’m not sure if I have a leg to stand on…
I also need to replace the consumer unit which could cost up to £800. So ballbark £3.3k for the works …

Is it worth negotiating down by this amount? Or will it come across as petty? £3.3k is nothing when the sale is hundreds of thousands…"

Looking at the council's [website](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/home-owners-services/making-alterations-to-your-home), it states that permission has to be applied for for even fairly minor alterations, along with paying administrative fees and legal fees for some larger changes.

I was wondering if council leaseholders tend to stick to these rules and what the level of risk is if internal alterations are made without going through these processes? e.g. do councils tend to enforce these rules/prosecute?

Hi all,

I need some help in understanding how to proceed with a water damage situation.

Basically, I left on holiday for two weeks and I had left the shower hose running (a little, not even quarter power) by accident. It unfortunately caused a leak through my bathroom and damaged the downstairs' neighbours ceiling. The landlord entered the home, with a repairer and the downstairs' neighbour and shut the hose to stop further damage. I did agree to pay for the damage, however I am not sure how to proceed with inspections and insurance as I do not have much experience with this.

My question is - I have standard home contents insurance, can I ask my insurer to help with this? How do I even proceed? Is there anything I should or should not do or say?

Any help is much appreciated.

The only things I changed when I  moved into my rental were the car insurance, contents insurance, breakdown cover. I'm also registered here for my electricity, water, council tax and internet.

What is my best bet here? Can I apply using my parent's address as nearly everything is still registered there? Or would I be better off moving eveything/some things over to my rental, although there will be time delay implications to this? 

Any insights warmly welcomed!"
Wall dents.,intellectualnt,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/rtz4pm/wall_dents/,"I just moved in to a new rented place the uk and after putting together the beds in my home the headboard beams, because of the screws, caused a few dents on the wall. I understand this means a few deductions from my security deposit but is my landlord potentially allowed to take the whole deposit?. The dents are not that severe. I have contents insurance for my home but not building insurance. Should I get one to solve the issue?. Also keep in mind I am a student and new to uk laws and I am not well versed. My initial idea was to just get building insurance the 1-2 months before I move out and simply put in a claim or tell my landlord to claim it. If any one has any suggestions to solve this problem please do. I also thought to buy some plaster to fix it but Im afraid it might leave a noticeable mark.

Cat scratched landlords furniture - rip,bunnycaff,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1587eaa/cat_scratched_landlords_furniture_rip/,"Hi, so TLDR -

\- London, UK

\- Paid rent every month on time, never had any problems

""As per The Animals Act 1971 you are responsible for the pet and must take reasonable care to ensure that it does not cause injury or damage. You may be held liable for any damage caused""

\- Cats have scratched leather accent chair in one area, pretty noticeable but not terrible - [https://i.imgur.com/BXEpBQZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BXEpBQZ.jpg)

\- Just discovered it's a £800 chair - WHY ?!?!?!?!

What's my best course of action - we paid 0 deposit and are paying £390 to the landlord's chosen cleaning company (with an added cost of £105 for the pet package - fumigation, deep cleaning etc.)

Do I/is it even possible to buy a last minute home contents insurance plan that covers accidental damage and then cancel it next month/the month after? Please advise me something other than fixing the chair, I've looked into all the options of that already and just want to weigh up some other options.

EDIT - The main reason we're worried is because through losing my job I fell into a 'zero deposit' tenancy, which is now why I'm terrified they'll want to fuck me over."

Water Damage + Leasehold,FinancialWilderness,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/st85pt/water_damage_leasehold/,"Hi everyone - just wanting to double check my understanding on a water damage issue in a leasehold flat. I’m in England.

In my flat I’ve got signs of water damage coming through a wall. No obvious pipes going into that area or cause. Spoke to managing agent who has advised getting multiple quotes from leak detection services. They should advise if it’s an issue affecting my flat and I can claim back through service charge if the cause is communal.

As a side note, plumbing in the block has been somewhat problematic with other leaks affecting elsewhere, which I suspect it might be here.

A couple of questions:

1) I thought buildings insurance would cover this even if just my flat, as being a leaseholder I can only contents insurance rather than home insurance. Is this just an insurance gap that can’t be filled in leasehold? 

2) Is my managing agent advising correctly on process? (I don’t quite trust them) Anything I should consider to be particularly careful about?

Many thanks for any words of wisdom!

All the best,

"Washing machine leak, minor water damage to flat below.",EnvironmentalCup4444,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1dcr5zg/washing_machine_leak_minor_water_damage_to_flat/,"I'm a tenant in Scotland, the flat came unfurnished and without a washing machine.

The machine flooded yesterday and poured out about 10l of water onto my kitchen floor before I noticed it, some of this must have found it's way down to my neighbours bathroom. Before I noticed the issue, my neighbour had knocked on my door frantically, panicking about a leak in their flat. I obliged and came to see the problem, then went to look around in my flat for any obvious sources. Once I found the washing machine I turned it off, unplugged it and informed my neighbour of the source of the issue and advised them they likely didn't need to bring in a plumber as it wasn't a pipe failure.

By this point, they'd already called a plumber to turn off the water and he arrived shortly after and turned it off at the source. Once I'd established that the washing machine was the sole source of the water leak, I turned the water back on to my flat.

They contacted my landlord/estate agent demanding they pay for it (honestly the call out charges for the electrician and plumber will be the bulk of it) and when they refused as they hadn't supplied the offending appliance they came to me demanding I foot the bill.

They demanded I come and took a look at the damage and I honestly can't see the issue beyond a dead lightbulb and a slightly peeling corner and a slightly soggy bathroom carpet, both of which I have no idea of the state of before the incident. 

They seem to expect that I'm personally liable for the damages, but after googling around it appears that unless I was negligent in some way I should be protected as a tenant?

They were livid when I refused to pay for the call out charges for the plumber and electrician and have threatened legal action, we don't have contents insurance.

Should I be expecting to be held legally responsible for the damage? I believe I did everything I reasonably could have to avoid causing damage to their property and informed both my landlord and the affected as quickly as possible."
Building insurance policy/accidental damage cover for leasehold flat,Leckere,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/vy7or1/building_insurance_policyaccidental_damage_cover/,"Hello, my partner and I are currently in the process of buying a leasehold flat. Our solicitor has raised that the freeholder's building insurance policy doesn't include accidental damage, and that she must inform our lender about this detail as it could affect our mortgage. We feel like this might not be necessary, and the sellers/sellers' solicitors/estate agent feel the same way (I know, I know, they would say that).

I'd never been familiar with the ins and outs of accidental damage before this whole process, but my understanding it it's stuff like cracking a bath tub or window pane and other damage to fixtures and fittings, but nothing massively serious. Apart from contents insurance, ofc I'm aware that we can't take up our own policy, but does anyone know of cover that would effectively work like accidental damage in a leasehold property?

My girlfriend and I are looking to start renting a place of our own in a few months, we’re both students so I have a couple of questions if someone could spare a few minutes! 

We’re both second year uni students at the moment, I am in a shared private rental at the moment with3 housemates and she is in uni halls (not really relevant but hey ho) we both work part time aswell as both receiving large student loans due to our families’ incomes. 
Can we include this as ‘income’ when applying for properties in the next few months, we plan to use money we have from this years loan aswell as next years to cover housing and bills. I like to think we’re a nice couple and we have good credit scores, but will being students put us at a disadvantage? 
As we both work, we easily cover food, fuel and both save every month.

Secondly, what kind of price would anyone guess bills would be for a 2 bed flat or 2-up-2-down house be (preferable in the east Kent area)  I’m trying to get a decent idea in mind so I can build an absolute budget
So far these are my guesstimates:
Rent - £1250 maximum in for the type of place we’re looking at.
Gas/electric -  £80.
Water - £20.
Contents insurance - £15.
Broadband/wifi - £30.
Tv license - £15. (I don’t even know if we need one)
I hope someone could possibly give some insight if they can! Thanks :)

damp & mould caused by upstairs flat,Not_Sugden,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1ai93ma/damp_mould_caused_by_upstairs_flat/,"(england) Hi all. This isn't quite a straightforward situation but looking for advice on what is best to do at the moment.

So my mother owns a flat in a building managed by the council, shes currently mentally unwell and has been vacant from the property for some time. I check in every so often and after checking in today there is water leaking from the ceiling, the ceiling is damaged, mould is growing on it, mould has grown on the sofa, lice on the walls, etc etc. House reeks of urine.

The upstairs property was also vacant, and they had a burst pipe because of the cold weather and thus a flood. So essentially these are the questions I have.

My mum has a morgage that has a metric shit ton of arrears, has not paid herself into any insurance in years and years, not paid the service charges from the council in years and years. Contents insurance out of the question obviously, the family seems to think there would be some sort of cover for the essential repairs, but to me that seems rather too hopeful. The morgage company are dragging their feet and just refuse to repossess, I don't know why, and they have had at least 5 years now, definetly more, with no payments and my mum has only officially been unwell for 2 years, but before that as far as official records go, no problem was known, thats a whole seperate though. Is there likely to be any cover?

The landlord of the upstairs property seems pretty reasonable, he has accepted that its his fault and offered to buy a de-humidifier and asked about insurance to which I had no idea when he asked, I got the impression if there was no cover he would be willing to do something to get things moving as the state of the property may or may not mean he cant get new tenants. If my mum is not able to engage with whoever she needs to for repairs, might he be able to initiate some sort of legal proceedings if hes unable to put in new tenants?

Ideally the flat needs to just be gotten rid of. But unfortunately my mum is unwilling to do that and I recognise that until there is a court order then that has to be her decision.

Furthermore the electrics, if we did get the demhumidifer, the light fixtures have been filled with water, I assume that we will need the go ahead from an electrician to even consider turning on the electric (its cut off at the meter as it hasn't been topped up).

Also, leaks from the upstairs property is not a new issue. The bathroom ceiling fell in a few years ago due to the upstairs leaks and the kitchen ceiling hasn't got much longer to go because this recent leak has made it bulging. Not sure if this is relevant or not.

What can we do to limit any damage to the building? It looks like there are some unsavoury things living there. The mould in the sofa looks like someones ran their finger over it (we suspect maybe a mouse or lice or something has been at it).

Is there anything else that I should be aware of? I think I know where I myself stand legally, I recognise that absoloutly none of this is my responsibility to engage with and that I can't make any decisions without my mum giving the go ahead herself, I just want to make sure that the least amount of hassle is caused, its been suggested that its possible that if left unactioned, this could write off the whole building? That sounds like a headache that nobody wants"

"Plumber caused huge leak that has damaged kitchen floor, whose insurance pays and who covers inhabitable period for lodger?",vitryolic,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/yq08z5/plumber_caused_huge_leak_that_has_damaged_kitchen/,"My plumber came to fit a new sink last week, and replaced 2 pipes, but the new piping sprung a leak later that day, he came back the next morning and said he fixed it. The leak left a big puddle but it was cleaned up quickly so there were no visible lasting issues. 

However it appears the leak was not resolved, and water started coming up through the kitchen laminate floorboards. It was hidden by stuff in the cupboard under the sink and I’ve been away, so was only found a week later, which is why the floor is now submerged. It also caused the downstairs ceiling light to fall out of its socket, although luckily the bulb and socket is still intact. 

I’ve used this plumber 2-3 times before with no issue. We’ve never signed a contract though, he usually quotes me for the work then I pay by bank transfer. I’ve asked him to urgently attend to fix the leak, and will call him first thing tomorrow. This means all water is off to prevent further damage. 

Unfortunately it’s also ruined the kitchen laminate since the boards have started to warp around the edges. I dread to think what it’s done to the floorboards underneath. The kitchen is part of a huge open plan kitchen/living room so would be difficult to patch without mismatching the rest of the floor. 

Is this something the plumber should be resolving with their Public Liability Insurance, or my building insurance? The last time I tried to claim for a leak from the balcony into my living room, I was told it would not be covered by building insurance. I don’t have contents insurance. 

If the plumber doesn’t reply to resolve the damage, can I call another plumber and send the original plumber the invoice? I’m due to be working abroad for 4 days from Thursday, and also have a lodger so I’d need to potentially put her up in a hotel if it’s not resolved ASAP before I go. Should I be looking for alternate emergency plumbers just in case tomorrow, or look up hotels and wait for the original plumber to fix it? 

Thanks for any advice, I don’t know many homeowners to ask."

Compensation for damaged belongings due to leaks in rented property,Tomcat_95,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/11yqj0s/compensation_for_damaged_belongings_due_to_leaks/,"Apologies if this is best suited to another sub but this was the most relevant one I could see.

We began renting a property (ground floor flat) in sept 22 in England. We notified estate agents at check in that shower was dripping water out the head, so the landlord sent his plumber round to replace mixer tap and hose/head. He inadvertently caused a leak which went under a wall, under floorboards and soaked concrete underneath. We only noticed once we heard water as we walked over floorboards. Contractors came and ripped the flooring up and left the concrete exposed for 4 months to dry. A dehumidifier was sent over for one month of this but over the 4 months we struggled massively with moisture and mould. 

Fast forward to late feb and contractors finally came to put new flooring down, only for us to hear water dripping again and our immersion tank was leaking water out the top causing the inside of the cupboard to be soaked.

As a consequence of this, firstly mould has been growing on walls and spreading  to our belongings so we’ve had to throw out a suit, shoes, bags etc and secondly our water bill is 300% what they’d expect for our property (I know we aren’t using this amount as we rented the flat 2 floors above which is identical and our usage was below average there)

We’ve become frustrated with all the issues so have asked for compensation to reimburse the destroyed belongings and increased water bill but estate agents claim this should be claimed against our own contents insurance. We feel this shouldn’t be the case as our excess is likely to be higher than the value of belongings destroyed and any subsequent insurance quotes will be higher due to making a claim but wasn’t sure where we/they stood legally on this?

We pay a lot of money to rent and property has been in a bad way since we moved in (still waiting for them to replace mouldy blinds we told them about at move in, and to replace section of mouldy plasterboard). Both caretaker for site and contractors have said they believe all our issues are a direct consequence of the leaks in the property and not due to lifestyle, I.e we are ventilating as best we can.

Any advice on how to proceed is greatly appreciated."

First off, big thanks to everyone here for all the advice and info that you all share on here. I'm about to exchange on my first property and this subreddit has been a gold mine of useful info and guidance. You guys are great.

I'm buying a 2 bed shared ownership flat in London. I'm 29, single, with no dependents. I'm trying to decide what insurance I need for my new home. Building insurance is covered by the Housing Association and I will be getting contents insurance. My mortgage broker has suggested Life/Critical Illness insurance to cover the value of my mortgage and income protection insurance to provide an income should I become unable to work. I know not to get anything through them and to find any insurance I do want through my own research.

Do you think these are essential, advisable or optional? Life insurance makes sense to me as that way the mortgage is covered regardless, income protection seems like a bit of an extravagance considering I'm already putting a lot of money towards a pension, personal savings through a stocks and shares ISA and I have generous sick leave and death at work cover through my employer. 

Any and all advice gratefully received."

Or, b) The date the offices were built, i.e. when the *building* was created.

Tenant's Insurance - meeting requirements,must-be-thursday,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/8ybhoe/tenants_insurance_meeting_requirements/,"I am about to move into a new flat, and a condition of this is that I have insurance. The only document I have so far signed is from the Letting Agent (i.e. have not yet signed the Tenancy Agreement) and this document requires me to have

An generic email I got from the agent says 

>  Your insurance must cover the Landlords' fixtures, fittings, furniture, as well as any tenant liability that you may incur as the occupier of the property.

My question is: would this be covered under most home contents insurance policies (the sort I would normally get in the absence of any specific requirements)? If so, would this fall under personal liability? A lot of insurance providers offer ""accidental damage cover"" at extra cost, but I don't care about accidental damage to my own property - do I therefore need this, or am I right in thinking that damage to the landlord's property would fall under personal liability regardless of how it was caused? Similarly, I assume the value of the personal liability limit is what would matter rather than the level of contents covered?"
Insurance policy without building regulation approval,markdjacob,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/hi5itp/insurance_policy_without_building_regulation/,"Hi all, we're currently trying to buy our first home and the survey has informed that some historic building work (an extension and loft conversion) were completed without building regulations approval. The seller is paying for indemnity insurance (they bought the house as-is) and this was done so many years ago that we're not worried about the council seeking to make any demands on the work (and the indemnity insurance should cover if they did). 

If further inspection confirms the extensions to be structurally sound, then does anyone know if we'd face troubles in insuring the house for day to day normal building and contents insurance? I'd be happy living in it if a structural engineer says it's all fine, but I'm really unclear as to whether I'd face any significant difficulties in getting an insurer to provide a policy. Does anyone else have any relevant experience? From what I gather, houses with questionable historic building work are far from rare in the UK...."
What counts as subsidence for buildings insurance?,BornTooHula,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/ss7bwe/what_counts_as_subsidence_for_buildings_insurance/,"Hi there,

I'm in the process of buying a Victorian detached home, built around 1880. To make sure I know what I'm getting into, I've had a level 3 RICS survey, damp and timber survey, and a structural engineers report.

Fortunately there were no nasty surprises, but the structural engineers report does describe some historic structural movement - here's an excerpt:  


>*I conclude that the main building has been affected by the historical effects of differential bedding-in settlement and associated slight separation of the rear wall. The damage remains structurally slight and it is apparent that there has been little activity for some considerable time and that the underlying mechanism of movement has ceased.* 

The last hurdle is to get buildings and contents insurance before completion. Given the above, I'm not sure whether to tick the box that says the house has suffered from subsidence. Doing so greatly reduces the number of insurers available to me.

If anyone has had a similar situation in the past, and can recommend a way forward, I'd love to hear it!

I am an FTB who is about to exchange and complete on a 2 bed flat (England). I wanted to understand that to maintain my home:

1.  what all steps I should take,  
2. on what frequency (annual, quarterly etc.) and
3. roughly how much to budget for it.

Here's the list I have come up with so far:

- Service charge, ground rent - as per lease
- Annual maintenance for HIU/Boiler ~£100-120
- Quarterly window cleaning - varies by size and number
- Quartely scrub the decking to prevent the green stuff from growing - DIY or a cleaner costs ~10-15/hr
- Semi-annually deep clean carpets etc.~£30 per room
- Annually bleed radiators every autumn- DIY 
- Monthly: 
-- check boiler pressure
-- top-up dishwasher salt
-- run the clean drum cycle on the washer

Other important items:

- keep an eye out for any sign of damage to mastic/sealants in kitchen and bathroom 

- Redecorate every 3-4 years

- if possible install a water softener (Harvey's?)

- ensure that the contents insurance is up to date based on value of belongings 


Would be great if you can add to this from your experience (or get your mom or dad to add 😅). Many thanks!"

* Is the 50-30-20 rule pretty safe to go by? I have about £500 left-over after all needs and wants paid off for the month (which is just below the '20' in the 50-30-20 rule, 18% to be specific). Looking for houses at around 260k max (including 26k deposit).
* Want to buy the best house I can afford so I don't have to move out so soon.
* I do have a mortgage in principle already. Obviously, this doesn't guarantee anything, but my calculations are based on the max the bank will lend me based on my current salary.
* £9k (about 4 months' worth of monthly outgoings) in emergency fund, will this be enough?
* Have I considered all monthly, 'one-off', and potential emergency costs (lists below)?
* Likelihood of being accepted for an emergency loan with £500 going into savings per month? Let's say 2 big emergencies occur and I use all of my emergency savings and then have to take out a loan. Have strong credit score.

&#x200B;

# Full version (non-TL;DR - warning, there's a fair bit here as I like to be as prepared as possible!):

It's a bit of a two-part question;

* Have I considered everything/most things in my list of monthly expenditure, 'one-off' expenditure, and potential emergency out-goings list?
* How much should I realistically be left over with after all bills have been paid, to account for emergency loans and savings in particular? As I'd want to be sure that I would be able to take out emergency loans if needed for say 10k for a new car (I wouldn't need to spend that much on a new car, though, maybe only about 5k or so, just something to get me from A-to-B) or whatever if my old one goes bust.

I'll say that I'd much rather move into a house that I really like and will stay in longer before moving, rather than a house I know I'll move on from in 3 or so years. I'm thinking more like 10+ years, so therefore I'm willing to spend more.

&#x200B;

# Current situation:

* Not in a rush to move out.
* Work from home, so I don't really use the car a whole lot, which means low mileage, petrol costs, repairs, etc.
* Live with parents (so I can save)
* Single and no kids, and planning to stay single for the foreseeable
* Tend not to spend money frivolously.

&#x200B;

# Current saved up finances:

£40,000

After paying all one-off payments (including deposit), I'll be left with around 9k emergency fund, which is around 4 months' worth of monthly payments. From research, the consensus is between 3-6 months wages in emergency fund, obviously the more the better/safer.

&#x200B;

# What I know I'll need to spend per month

(Note: High/Medium/Low means the severity of whether I can reduce the out-goings if needed, High means I can't reduce it/very little, Medium I can compromise a bit more and Low I can heavily reduce the out-goings if needed):

* Mortgage: £1100
* Council tax: £131.25 (with 25% single occupancy discount) (£175 is the average)
* (Medium) Entertainment/Food Subscriptions/Phone etc.: £61.82
* (Medium) Food: Around £300 (this is both needs and wants, that's why it's higher than average, but I can definitely drop it by, say, £100 if absolutely necessary)
* Utility Bills (Gas, Electric, Water, Internet):
   * Gas & Electric: £250 (Seems a lot but I work from home so this might be accurate on the electric side of things, gas shouldn't be too bad as I don't like to leave the heating on for very long if I do turn the heating on the very rare occasion)
   * Water: £35
   * Internet: £35
* Check critical illness and life insurance (need it to take out a mortgage): £35
* (Low) Petrol: £75 (Overestimated)
* Breakdown cover: £15
* Car tax: £20
* Car insurance: £50
* (High) Dentist: £19.91
* (High) Barbers: £7.50
* Home insurance aka Building, electric, plumbing, home contents insurance: £43
* Boiler: £20
* (High) Toiletries (Including contact lenses): £10
* (High) Security subscription for cameras and alarms: £32
* (High) +Entertainment (£29 every 4 months, which every month:) £7.25
* (High) Medical supplies: £1.58
* (Low) Clothes
* (Very Low, currently) Dating dates
* (Low) Christmas, birthday, mother’s/father’s day gifts
* Toilet roll: £6
* Cleaning products: £12 + £4.50
* Light bulbs: Negligible.

Total comes to around £2271 per month.

&#x200B;

# What I know I'll need to pay as a one-off:

* House Surveyor (Intermediate survey, not basic. High survey for really old building): £500
* Solicitors: \~£1500.
* Removal and moving-in costs: Negligible.
* Arrangement fee: £999
* Valuation fee (Should be included in Arrangement fee)
* Indemnity Insurance: (Not sure, yet, but it's a one-off payment unless your property significantly grows in value. Plus, the original homeowner may have already taken out indemnity insurance, so you can just take it over.)
* Go see mortgage broker/advisor for: \~£250
* Home buyer's protection insurance: \~£75

Furniture and appliances, including:

* Corner desk
* Fridge
* Sofa bed?
* Microwave
* Air fryer
* Double bed
* Washing machine
* Dish washer.
* Crockery and cutlery
* Oven
* Chest of drawers or wardrobe
* Dining table and chair(s) (low prio)
* Outside table and chairs (low prio)
* Curtains and curtain rails (potentially)
* Lamp shades

= \~£1000

* Security cameras inside and outside the house.
* Security alarms.
* Stamp duty (ONLY applicable to properties over 250k and only NON-FTB homes, which means I don’t have to worry about it for my first home as you only pay it if it exceeds 450k on your first house):
* Changing locks

So far it's around £4,325 in total. But that’s without indemnity insurance, removal and moving-in costs (low as I'll be buying new furniture for the most part), (potentially) valuation fee, security equipment. For arguments sake **let's say it's £5,000 in total**.

&#x200B;

# Things I should save up for in the case of an emergency (please let me know of other things that you/people-you-know have had to shell out for in general emergency cases):

* Increase in mortgage interest rates if they do go up (although I'm currently looking at a 5-year fixed rate mortgage, that's what I currently have for my MIP, so by then my salary will be higher when the term comes to an end)
* House repairs
* Car repairs and MOT.
* A new car if the other one goes bust.
* I guess I'll probably have to take out loans if I need to pay for house repairs, new appliances, etc.
* House decorating/renovation/additions (to increase value when I come to sell it – this obviously isn't an emergency but a future cost to maybe think about to improve the chance of selling the house in \~10 years)

&#x200B;

# Summary and afterthoughts

I'm trying to ascertain how much I should realistically be spending per month on a mortgage and monthly bills.

For the max I can borrow, I would be left with around £500 to save per month. I currently don't have any debt (student loan but I've already deducted it), so I can put most if it into my emergency saving fund.

Would you say that will be enough for savings? I've pretty much included my 'wants' in my monthly budget, and if we say follow the 50-30-20 rule, for my max mortgage I'll be at 82.61% (52.61% for musts, 30% for wants – although I have less of a percentage for wants and more for needs, so it's more like 62-20, and then about 18% for savings.

Would people say as long as I keep as close to the 50-30-20 (or 80-20) rule, then I should be fine?

Just to add on: If I don't max out my mortgage, I can go down by about 10-20k, which means I'll have a couple of thousand more in my emergency fund as I won't be spending as much on the deposit, but the change in mortgage itself will only save me about £100 per month if I get a house that is 20k cheaper than the max price-range I'm going for (260k).

The reality is, for the area I'm looking for, the house quality drastically falls off in terms of location, size, and things I'm really looking for in a house. The 260kers are typically perfect for me. Anything less and I'm heavily compromising. Admittedly the market is bad right now anyway, so hopefully the warmer weather might bring about more on the market.

Another thing is I can simply just wait. I can get a bigger deposit and maybe reduce the mortgage payments (slightly?) in say 12 months (I'm saving around £1,600 per month currently). I guess the only thing is we don't know if interest rates will go up, down, stay the same, etc. I wouldn't expect it to rocket, though. It seems like it's gradually beginning to go down.

But yes, any thoughts on anything above would be great. Please let me know if you'd like any further details/I've forgotten anything.

Thanks for reading."
Renting / insurance question [x-post r/askUK],roxieh,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/7gmgrv/renting_insurance_question_xpost_raskuk/,"Hey there.

I'll keep this brief. I'm about to sign a tenancy for a 6 month rent in the UK. I've been renting for nearly 10 years so I'm not unfamiliar with the process.
One thing I have noticed sneaking into standard tenancies from letting agents is a clause in the agreement that says they will not release keys to the property until the tenant has provided proof that they have insurance that covers the landlord's property for accidental damage caused over the period of the agreement.

There are only a few companies that seem to offer tenant's liabiltiy insurance (that's what it's called) and it looks like it's in the region of about £60. This is completely separate to any contents insurance you as a tenant/renter may wish to take out for your own personal belongings.
Isn't this illegal? Surely the landlord can cover his/her own things for accidental damage to their property with their own specific landlord's insurance? Or is that not how it works? Why can an agent force a prospective tenant to have this?

Insight/guidance/advice appreciated.

Cheers."
How to judge whether a building is a flood risk and impact on insurance,reallyreallyanon,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/lkffav/how_to_judge_whether_a_building_is_a_flood_risk/,"My partner and I are looking at buying our first property. 

One of the areas we are looking in (St Denys, Southampton), is near a river and has some houses that are at flood risk according to the [government flood warning information service.](https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/long-term-flood-risk)

There is also a DEFRA site showing [previous flood data](https://environment.data.gov.uk/DefraDataDownload/?mapService=EA/RecordedFloodOutlines&Mode=spatial).

The flood warning information service seems to be more cautious, and seems to have a larger at-risk area, but would anyone know which one would be important for getting building and contents insurance? I am aware that a lot of providers won't offer anything if there is a flood risk, 

In the rules, it asks for some details. I don't think they are relevant, but just in case:

* budget is 200 - 250k
* area is Southampton
* looking to buy a house

Thanks in advance for any help!"
Power Outages in rented HMO,Ztar86,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/pdzszi/power_outages_in_rented_hmo/,"I live in a most fabulous HMO with a nice landlord. We all get on great. There are a couple of issues though. The most annoying being power outages. They don't happen constantly...Its perhaps every month or so. But often it happens randomly so the landlord can't give a warning (landlord lives in the same property with us). He is aware of the issues and does put effort into fixing it, along with his handyman. But it still happens more than I would expect. I have lived in some real sh\*t holes in the past and I have never had issues like this before. I have electrical stuff in the house (PC's and such) that are at risk if the power goes out randomly.

So I have a few questions:

* How often does an unexpected power outage need to happen before it would be considered something I could hold the landlord responsible for in some legal way? 
* Is the responsibility solely on me to have contents insurance for my electricals (I will be getting this asap). Or would I be in my right to ask for compensation for any damaged equipment?
* Would it be reasonable to expect my landlord to pay for a UPS for my electricals to prevent damage if he is unable to fix the issue? I have a work PC that could be damaged if this continues.

The landlord is really nice so I don't want to fall out with him so I want to deal with this delicately. I will also look over my contract and see if there is anything useful in there. But I wanted the opinions of real people in addition.

Thanks in advance :)"
Red flags with broker? ,Bethsywesy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1d8nnwq/red_flags_with_broker/,"Can anyone advise if my mortgage application process seems normal?

 

So for context we are buying a relatives property which is currently occupied by a tenant. We viewed the property on Wed 15th May, and had our offer accepted on Thurs 16th.

A family friend works for a local mortgage broker (albiet in life/home and contents insurance) but he rang me on the 16th and told me he would pass my details to a broker within his team.

She then called me later that day to get the details, and then shortly after the call sent over two rates for HSBC (one was 35 year and one was 40 years).

I noticed both rates were offering £1.2k cashback for FTB upon completion – I rang her to just to confirm this wasn’t a mistake as it seemed too good to be true, but she confirmed no she was sure and that this is an incentive a lot of banks offer. I happily confirmed the 35 year rate with her over the phone. This is important later. 

I asked her to send me a list of all documents we required which she provided on Friday 17th. She also asked for my partners email address and contact details as there was something she had to send for us to sign (as of 5th June my partner has never been contacted)

I got back with everything Wed 22nd May as it took a while to get the docs. She replied on Thursday 23rd afternoon to thank me for the documents.

I then did not hear anything back for nearly a week so I decided to reach out again on Tuesday 28th to ask if there was anymore paperwork required from us and could she let us know when she is submitting so that we can give the tenant in the property notice to vacate. From my perspective on friends etc buying houses generally the broker submits the documentation/application ASAP?

She didn’t reply to this email but she sent a rather frantic apologetic email at 7pm that evening saying that she had made a mistake and the HSBC cashback rate she had sent us we would not be eligible for as its actually only for people buying a home with an A-C EPC rating. I had my suspicions this wasn’t correct initially, and as someone who should have been familiar with the industry surely this is something she shouldn’t have overlooked? Especially after being questioned on this?

I replied in the morning of Wed 29th as I didn’t see the email. Anyways I told her that was fine mistakes happen, I was happy to proceed with the revised rate she had sent along with her email, but also asked could she please let me know when she was submitting (as I wasn’t getting much communication from her, a long time seemed to have passed, and she hadn’t replied the last time I asked). Again no response.

On Wednesday 29th evening I received a call from HSBC asking to do a physical valuation of the property. We arranged a time on Friday 31st and that was carried out. I thought it was weird that the broker didn’t even give us a heads up that we should expect that. I am a FTB so I still didn’t know if this mean’t our application was submitted.

I emailed on Monday 3rd to ask if she could please tell me if the application was submitted yet (this was the third time I had to ask). She replied and said that she had submitted the application on Tues 28th and that she had emailed about it and maybe it went to my spam email address? This was doubly weird as she was saying she submitted Tuesday 28th (I had not confirmed that the new non cashback rate was acceptable till the Wed 29th?) and I checked all email boxes including spam and junk and I had received nothing. I had emailed with her a lot previously so why would her emails start going to spam?

I had mentioned in my email that the valuation was completed the Friday and she commeted that she didn’t even know about that as HSBC hadn’t contacted her??

I replied anyways and said to her that I had tripled checked all my mailboxes so could she confirm that the email was defintely sent to me and to the right address as this was info we need to know and going forward I don’t want to miss anything important. No response!

Is this lack of communication and time taken normal? Its going on 3 weeks tomorrow since our initial contact with the broker!!

As a side note we are currently 6 working days since submitting our application – with 2 working days since our valuation. Anyone with HSBC tell us is this normal? Since we can’t seem to get much info from the broker…"
